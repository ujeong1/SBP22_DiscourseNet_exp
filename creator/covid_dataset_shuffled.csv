Looking around Framingham, there were many examples of light in the darkness. Neighbors helping neighbors with food or finding at home covid tests. Keep Framingham Beautiful continues to bring people together to keep our streets and parks clean. Veterans Park has undergone an incredible transformation and stands as a wonderful tribute to our veterans. We celebrated the opening of the new Fuller Middle School.  The Framingham Coronavirus Community Outreach partnered with MetroWest Pharmacy to help vaccinate our residents. Thank you to all of you for your selfless acts of kindness and love of community. 

Tomorrow our second mayor, third Council and third School Committee will be sworn in - what an optimistic way to begin a new year! 

We have much more to do to make Framingham a better place for everyone. It is my hope for 2022 that we put aside the grudges, the fights, the lies, and roll up our sleeves to seize this moment. To some, the negativity is their playbook for winning. The lies they spread and the attitude of doing anything to win are part of the politics of old. There should be no room for that in 2022 in Framingham. 

We must be better than that as we start this new year together. I am ready to stand with you, stand with our community and build a Framingham we are proud of for everyone. 

Thank you for your support this year. I look forward to seeing the work we can accomplish together in 2022. 

Happy New Year!"

There’s been a lot of news lately about our schools and the numerous challenges they are facing, and focusing instead on some positive development at our schools is long overdue.   
We are so fortunate to have an amazing band program at all levels in our school district, up through Carlsbad High School. Ken Young, Robert Galindo and the entire band do an outstanding job.  
At a recent middle school concert, Young talked about how many of the top 20 students in each graduating class are in band, and it was an impressive number. Even more significant- only a very small number of the students with the band haven’t completed high school. The message was clear – encourage your kids to stay in band (or another similar activity) if you want them to succeed. 
There’s also a great feeder program - Young and Galindo are both involved at the middle school level, and transition to the high school is very smooth. Kids get to feel included at a very young age.
Of course, band isn’t the only local activity that is wonderful for students, but it is certainly one that comes to mind for anyone who participated in this past weekend’s Martin Luther King Jr. march. The band led the way. 
Special credit to members of strut - also known as the drum line. The outstanding drum line participates in community events and parades – even when the entire band isn’t able to do so. Strut won the travelling trophy at last week’s Martin Luther King Jr. march and they performed at the ceremony as well. Members of our band also did a great job at Ricky Garcia’s recent awards ceremony. They make every event more special. 
It’s easy to get caught up in the testing lines and COVID-19 notifications and just feel like that’s the only thing going on right now. But it’s important to stop and remember just how many really neat things are going on at our schools as well. Our basketball teams both have winning records, and we have kids practicing hard every day at sports such as swimming and wrestling. We have after school STEM, theater, choir, BPA programs, and numerous other activities. We have our incredible band program, and students who are so inspired by this activity that they are also improving in school. Mostly, we have an incredibly dedicated group of men and women who are coaching, directing, teaching and instructing every day – and who are giving our children and grandchildren positive memories that will last a lifetime. 
We can’t let the barrage of COVID-19 testing texts cause us to forget about all of the great developments that are taking place as well. 

Sincerely,

""We are appalled by the behaviour of the Prime Minister and his staff at No. 10. The revelations about all the various gatherings/parties which were held in clear breach of the Covid regulations are shocking. The fact that the rules were broken by the very people who had made them is most alarming. The parties were being held at the same time as ordinary law-abiding citizens were making enormous personal sacrifices in order to keep to the rules. They were not able to visit or say good-bye to dying relatives; they could not attend funerals; they could not visit the lonely; could not meet friends in a park. They suffered real distress and anguish.

""The Prime Minister must take responsibility for the rule breaking in No. 10. He did nothing to stop the partying, even attending some events himself. His claims that he thought that some of the parties were ""work meetings"" is pathetic, and demonstrates a complete lack of judgement. People are angry - very angry. They have no respect for the Prime Minister, who is perceived to be a law- breaker, and they have no trust whatsoever in him or his judgement. We call on him to do the honourable thing, and to resign.

""It would be consistent for our MP, Julie Marson, to similarly urge the Prime Minister to resign. Ms Marson is on record as saying that all elected councillors in local government should be worthy of trust. How much more should the leader of the Government be worthy of trust? We challenge Ms Marson to do the logical thing, and, herself, to call on the Prime Minister to resign."""

WHERE TO GET TESTED
Hingham, Cohasset, Hull, and Scituate were awarded state funding to open a new testing facility in Hingham. The site is up and running and offers PCR tests at no cost. Additional rapid antigen tests and antibody tests are available for larger fees. The drive-through testing site at 335 Lincoln St. is open four days a week – Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday – from 7am to 4pm. To schedule a test, go to https://www.covidclinic.org/hingham-ma/. To find additional testing sites, visit mass.gov/GetTested. 
 
WHEN TO GET TESTED, QUARANTINE
DPH is now advising all residents to seek COVID-19 tests when exhibiting COVID symptoms, or five days following a known close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID. The new isolation protocols released on December 29 do not require a COVID-19 test to exit isolation after having a positive test. This general rule also applies to childcare and K-12. COVID-19 exposed individuals with no symptoms do not need to quarantine if you are fully vaccinated and not yet eligible to receive a booster OR if fully vaccinated and have received their booster OR if they had COVID and it is less than 90 days since they were diagnosed. More information on this may be found here: https://bit.ly/3nomix5. 
 
BAKER ADMIN SECURES CONTRACT FOR 26M RAPID ANTIGEN TESTS
This week, the Administration announced an order was placed with iHealth to supply the state with 26 million rapid antigen tests over the next 3 months. The tests will be prioritized to support K-12 schools and childcare settings. The agreement allows for shipments of tests to arrive on a rolling basis in the Commonwealth, but the Administration noted that the timing and shipment amounts will vary depending on international shipping and amount of production in a given week.
 
NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVATED TO SUPPORT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
Governor Baker activated 500 additional members of the National Guard to support the state’s health care system. This order expands the National Guard activation of 500 members announced on December 21 to support non-clinical functions in the Commonwealth’s hospitals. Prioritized uses for the newly activated 500 members will be to provide additional non-clinical staffing at community hospitals and high-volume emergency departments, public hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and dialysis centers. These guard personnel will be deployed beginning the week of January 17.

ADMIN AWARDS ADDITIONAL $13.5M FOR COVID VACCINE EFFORTS
The Baker-Polito Administration today announced $13.5 million to support community organizations working in the cities and towns hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the Massachusetts Vaccine Equity Initiative to increase awareness, acceptance and access to the COVID-19 vaccine. These latest grants are part of the Administration’s investment of more than $46.5 million into the effort."

The final report, published by Ofsted, grades Children's Services Good, across the board as inspectors commented that ""Senior leaders have worked relentlessly to address the recommendations from the last full inspection in 2017. They have built on the strengths identified at that time, and services are now of a good standard.""

Inspectors noted the added challenges from the pandemic saying that ""COVID-19 has placed huge pressures on children and families in Bedford Borough. Many staff in the local authority have been personally affected by the virus. Despite this, services have adapted well to significant changes in demand through the past 20 months.""

The report also said, ""Children's views are listened to, supported and acted on. Children, including those with disabilities, attend meetings about themselves, and are supported to contribute meaningfully.""

Inspectors also said that, ""Leaders have created a positive, relationship-based culture which they model in their relationships with staff, who in turn adopt a respectful, courteous approach in their work with families. Leaders are visible and approachable.""

Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Elects New Executive Board Leadership

Sheriff of Cumberland County Tennessee Casey Cox, Elected to Appalachia HIDTA Executive Board Leadership as Vice-Chair

London, KY: The Executive Director of Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (AHIDTA), Vic Brown, has announced that Casey Cox, Sheriff of Cumberland County, Tennessee, has been unanimously elected to serve as Vice-Chair of the 2022 AHIDTA Executive Board. The Vice-Chair rotates into the Chair position the following year. Therefore, Sheriff Cox will serve as the Chairman for 2023.

The AHIDTA Executive Board provides executive leadership and direction on a multitude of issues pertaining to drug enforcement throughout the AHIDTA area of responsibility, which includes 94 designated counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.  The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program is administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). A component of the Executive Office of the President, ONDCP, was created by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. ONDCP advises the President on drug-control issues, coordinates drug-control activities and related funding across the Federal government, and produces the annual National Drug Control Strategy, which outlines Administration efforts to reduce illicit drug use, manufacturing and trafficking, drug-related crime and violence, and drug-related health consequences.

Appalachia HIDTA is an important component of the President’s National Drug Control Strategy, which provides additional federal resources to help eliminate or reduce drug trafficking and its harmful consequences. Law enforcement organizations within HIDTA assess drug trafficking problems and design specific initiatives to reduce or eliminate the production, manufacture, transportation, distribution, and chronic use of illegal drugs, as well as money laundering.  

Director Brown said, “Sheriff Casey Cox is a well-respected law enforcement professional. 

🤣🚨🚨This is also the same Sheriff who has said multiple times that mental health does NOT matter! 🤦‍♂️ 🤬🚨

Watch this video on a WV state coordinator  with the Appalachian High Intensity Drug Task Force and 20 year retired lieutenant’s thoughts on HANDLE WITH CARE. https://youtu.be/-P_qnbVkR8c

Fostering Crossville wants you to think about some things. Every single one of us have been through something traumatic. It is very important to not forget about adults (18+) because if we forget about adults or give up on them and continue making them go in circles they can in some way continue to harm others or themselves even if you think it’s mild. Some may think an adult who yells at a child isn’t that damaging but verbal abuse is still verbal abuse and it is just as harmful as physical abuse. 

Covid-19 traumatized us all and many of us couldn’t stay isolated because we know how damaging and unnatural it is. Isolation has been documented on childrens brains for decades through institutions and it causes brain damage. Every child in this state and in our county has brain damage even if you think it is small it is still pretty damaging but can be healed. If adults are not helped and then educated then there is no way our children will be helped because as they grow they will continue to be abused or hurt by someone and it may not even be intentional. Covid-19 added to everyone’s stressors which doubles the risk of mental illness. 

🚨Lastly, when will the task force start to include investigations on Big Pharma regarding mental/medical health professionals and the use of psychotropic medications which have killed more than HEROIN and has wrecked havoc on thousands of those still living????🚨

Matt Johnson, the undercover investigator for the animal rights group #DxE, DirectActionEverywhere.com, was about to face trial for his role in documenting the violence against these animals, when charges were abruptly dropped in the midst of a media frenzy over the scandal. Meanwhile, Dr. Crystal Heath, a #veterinarian with OurHonor.org has been working to raise awareness about the atrocity of Ventilation Shutdown. She's pleading with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) to reclassify it as a completely and utterly unacceptable form of depopulation. AVMA and any of the companies involved are invited on any time to respond. Dr. Heath says Ventilation Shutdown exposes the brutality of our food system and the need to stop the expansion of animal agriculture and reverse course! We must determine how many pigs were exterminated in this brutal way during the COVID crisis, while it was being falsely portrayed as euthanasia. Visit UnchainedTV.com for more. #unchainedtv"

you but there is a sacrilegious joke I want to tell you Not to shock you but to redeem its punch line The joke which is a riff on end time Christianity goes like this Jesus is coming Look busy It s not a great joke but I think it has a truth that can bless us Jesus is coming Look busy or better yet get busy Get to work doing what Jesus wants us to do to make this world welcome for him and for us all That is what Advent is all about Advent is a season of preparation to make the way ready for the King of kings and Lord of lords If only I was as intentional about doing that as Home Depot is The first Christmas items appeared at Home Depot before Labor Day Go in there today and you ll find the place plastered with poinsettias and home decorations and artificial trees and on and on and on If I was as serious about making Jesus welcome as Home Depot is about making a buck my faith would really move mountains The journalist Nicholas Kristof has an annual column about alternative Christmas giving This year he touted a project called Cure Blindness which offers cataract surgery for poor people in Asia and Africa will restore a person s sight Another organization Campaign for Female Education seeks to get African girls in school and out of child marriages will educate a girl for one year in high school will cover a year of elementary school This program has enabled young African women to get their education and to pay it forward because each graduate mentors and sponsors another girl Talk about changing the world Yes there is only one Savior of the world But by the grace of God it is amazing what we can do to help in that saving work The Youth Service Bureau s Project ReinDEAR the local CASA program sponsoring a child through Compassion International Think of all the wonderful ways we can be about the Lord s work by making things just a little bit more right and good and just and loving See if you can include some alternative Christmas gifts in your gifting this year Instead of another sweater Uncle Harold might really like a Heifer Project duck Cousin Mary might appreciate a gift being given in her name rather than receiving a gift herself Try it and see how that changes the feel and meaning of Christmas for you for good We re in the middle of a pandemic an economic crisis and a poisonous political climate All of that can make us feel pretty powerless After all none of us is going to come up the cure for Covid But we can wear a mask and practice social distancing while we wait for the vaccine to arrive which thankfully is on its way Doing what we can do while we wait is a God given power all of us have And that is what God wants us to do while we wait for God s kingdom to come in full We are to anticipate that reality which only God can bring by doing those things which only we can do As we do what is within our power to do we prepare the way and hasten that day when our Savior fully reigns when righteousness is truly at home when this tired old universe and sin sick world are transformed into a new heavens and a new earth If you think that our power to prepare the way for something that big is just a lot of hype then you have a bunch of geophysicists who will disagree with you During the lock down earlier this year when we all stayed home geologists who monitor tremors and watch for earthquakes reported that the lock down actually decreased the amount of surface tremor for the entire planet Turns out that when billion people do something small it adds up to something that is pretty big Don t underestimate what God can and will do in and through you Your actions have consequences And when you act with God eternally powerful things happen Getting sober Forgiving an enemy Burying a grudge Mentoring a child Living with hope Sharing in love These gospel acts are the basic building blocks of the Kingdom of God So don t just spend this month getting ready for Christmas Get ready for your Savior Welcome him Don t wait passively Do what you can where you are as the Lord leads you As you do you will welcome Christ into your life which shall be blessed and into the world which shall be changed Let us prepare the way In reading this your heart may be stirred What you re feeling is the Holy Spirit drawing you to Christ To begin or renew a relationship with Jesus just pray Lord help me receive your love I regret the wrong I ve done Forgive me Jesus I believe you are God s Son and the Savior of the world Be my Savior Save me from myself Save me for yourself Enter my heart Fill me with your Holy Spirit Help me to serve you faithfully and well Help me to love as you love Lead me in your Way Truth and Life now and forever Continue to show me who you are and who I am in you Amen If you pray this prayer find a pastor They ll show you how to live for Christ with purpose peace and joy Jesus says Behold I make all things new That definitely includes YOU

Conference
 
What is the future of #work? What concepts and strategies will lead to a future that works for everyone? What actions do we need to take to make a difference? The international conference ‘The Future of Work’ will tackle crucial issues such as #diversity, #globalization, #sustainability and #digitalization in relation with #labour. 

More info and registration here: https://www.istitutosvizzero.it/conferenza/the-future-of-work/
 
Moreover, on Monday 15th of November,  the conference will be launched by the online kick-off talk ‘Work at the Crossroads’ with speakers Isabelle Ferreras (University of Louvain), Jakub Samochowiec (GDI Gottlieb Duttweiler Institut), Juliane Schiel (University of Vienna), and  Mara De Monte (Direttrice ad interim, TASC Platform, The Graduate Institute) analysing past, present and future developments of work. 
 
Covid-19 demonstrated that change is needed to address not only an unexpected virus, but also the long-term transformations that have occupied our minds and behaviour for years. Indeed, nothing particularly new was brought to the table during the pandemic, but the clarity with which the virus revealed some key problems in our society was striking. Ever-increasing social inequalities, digitalisation and the impact of technology on our daily lives, as well as climate change, pose significant challenges that, if not addressed, risk impacting future generations. The decisions and actions we take today will define tomorrow’s society.
 
This conference is an opportunity for citizens to take part in an informed discussion on current trends in the field of work, focusing on changes in #labourmarkets, #education and #labourrelations.
 
The project is in collaboration with the Embassy of Switzerland in Italy, the University of Lausanne and LUISS University in Rome.
 
The talk and the conference are part of ‘Dispute’, a series of events organised by Istituto Svizzero. Each year, it provides a platform of exchange and public debate, tackling the most challenging issues of our time and their impact on global society.

We, the Angry Tias and Abuelas, seek continued funding for our key migrant support projects in Northern Mexico and the Texas border region.   We operate in the lower Rio Grande Valley, across from the dangerous Mexican state of Tamaulipas. We estimate that there are at least five thousand migrants in Reynosa and its surrounding areas.  At least two Tías cross into this dangerous area on a regular basis to assist this vulnerable population.  Well over a third of these people are minors. Many of the women are pregnant, but have received no adequate medical care. The majority of the people have suffered extreme trauma, including being attacked at gunpoint, raped, beaten or kidnapped, while waiting to be admitted to the U.S.  As you may know, currently, the families are automatically turned away from the U.S. under the Covid restrictions of Title 42.
The Angry Tias and Abuelas seek funding for:
1.     Rent for safe, privately owned and operated housing for the migrants trapped in Tamaulipas
2.     Food and medical assistance and other humanitarian support for these families in Tamaulipas
3.     Limited legal funds, or “low bono” assistance, to migrants facing long term detention or imminent return to a dangerous homeland
4.     Support and assistance to recently arrived migrants in the USA, especially those released under humanitarian or medical grounds.   This includes information, food, short term hotel rooms, medical referrals as needed, and assistance in arranging transportation to their families or sponsors in the U.S.
As those of you who have been following us know, the Angry Tias and Abuelas are an entirely volunteer organization. We have virtually no overhead, because we use our own homes, vehicles, telephones and other equipment to carry out our work.    Your donations, great and small, make a very big difference and are tax deductible. You can donate on-line at www.angrytiasandabuelas.com"

- Oswald Chambers 

At the end of 2020, I saw posts on social media where people were relieved that 2020 was over. Surely 2021 would be better. Covid would go away, everyone would get along again, and we’d “get back to normal.” 

On January 6, 2021, the US capitol was breached. Covid, like a hydra, keeps growing new heads. Racial tensions continue to simmer. The murder rate in the US increased 30% in 2021 as compared to 2020. Sexual depravity is the norm. The occult is mainstream. Two days ago, I visited a Barnes and Noble. A mother and her teenage daughter were standing next to the occult book section near the main aisle. The daughter was arguing with her mother because she wanted to buy a book of spells “so she could learn to talk to spirits.” Thankfully, her mom responded with “No, you don’t need that!” But, chances are high that her daughter has been exposed to the occult prior to visiting Barnes and Noble. If Mom isn’t a believer and can’t explain to her daughter why flirting with the occult is dangerous, her daughter may eventually get what she wants. 

Youth and adults continue to exit the church. Last summer, a guy started a website offering a program on how to walk away from the faith. Every day the news has stories of church leaders exposed for sexual sin, arrogance, or spiritual abuse. The porn epidemic in the church continues to rage, nearly unabated. 

In most churches you won’t hear a word about the above Sunday morning. The faithful stroll into church, Starbucks coffee cups in hand. “Back to our verse by verse study in 1 Corinthians on spiritual gifts. The worship band really rocked it today. Hey, what’s for lunch?” Zzzzzzzz. 

My family and I spent much of 2021 visiting churches of all sizes looking for a new home church (we moved to Arizona in 2020). Most of the church websites I looked at said “Come as you are.” We didn’t hear “You can’t stay as you are” or about “the narrow road that leads to life that few find” (Mathew 7:13-14). They want everyone to feel comfortable, which is a part of the problem. I’m not talking about chairs. The pastor of one church we visited apologized for giving a message on depression “because it wasn’t a pleasant topic.” Another church played secular music immediately after their service. The pastor at another church based his sermons on “The Chosen,” and was encouraging the flock to watch that week’s episode.  
 
No wonder people are walking away from the faith; churches like this are just another entertainment option. I had hoped to find a church that spent time praying Sunday mornings. Forget it. Gonna have to start a home church if I want that.  Whatever happened to being devoted to teaching, fellowship, and prayer? (Acts 2:42), confronting the church over its sexual sin as Jesus told us to do in Revelations, and challenging people to go all out with God? Maybe watching The Chosen will give me the answers. (I’m not knocking the program, but we have to discern between Cultural Christianity/Christian entertainment, and actually doing what has impact and is commanded in Scripture.)  

Or maybe I’ll leave the TV off and go rogue by spending at least an hour every day in prayer, cultivate a passionate love relationship with the Lord, and focus on doing what God’s word says to do instead of merely studying it. Our team at Blazing Grace will continue to expose the sexual sin in the church and offer healing and freedom for those who want it. And I’ll focus on making my brief life count for eternity and encourage others to do the same. 

Later this month, my next book will be released: The Way of the Rogue Christian: Living a Life that Counts for Eternity. The book will challenge and equip you and your church to live a life of spiritual impact and significance. More on the book in the weeks ahead.  

2022 will be the year of the Rogue Christian. We live in dark times that are getting darker. Lukewarm believers will either fade away, or they’ll keep playing church as long as they don’t get offended or forced out of their comfort bubble. Then they’ll look for another entertainment option, oops, I mean… church.  

Those who aren’t playing games with sin or God are the ones who will be tough enough to endure to the end, no matter what happens. It is the Rogue Christians, the doers of the word who are willing to go all the way with God, who will make their lives count for eternity. 

""And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.""
Matthew 24:10-13

I will leave you with this. We see a lot of men who are playing games with pornography and sexual sin. They’re destroying themselves, their marriages, their families. If this is you, please don’t wait a day longer. Get help now. Don’t waste your life on the pathetic love-counterfeit of lust."

I have experienced problems at home too and don’t doubt covid has affected the Royal Mail workforce. Before Christmas letters were only being delivered every other day in part of our community for example. 

I’m meeting Royal Mail again to discuss the situation now and it would be useful to hear of any problems you’ve experienced in recent weeks. Do get in touch if you’ve had delays or missed items please!

While millions of people faced lockdown restrictions last winter and were forced to spend Christmas alone or watching loved ones die, the Tories and their friends partied on. After two years of Tory “crony contracts”, millions are acutely aware that lies, corruption and cover ups are at the heart of the system.
But the attacks on working-people keep coming.
2022 begins with the Covid-19 variant Omicron sweeping the country. Boris Johnson is not bringing in new measures to protect public health because he puts profits before people thus ensuring more pressure will be piled on the NHS.
While billionaires thrive and capitalists enrich themselves as the pandemic rages, workers face rocketing prices – particularly in energy.

Faced with multiple crises the Tories answer is to divide-and-rule with racism and to repress dissent with more authoritarianism.

Meanwhile Keir Starmer’s Labour Party continues to move to the right, looking to repeat Tony Blair’s New Labour. This comes as millions are disgusted that the war criminal Blair was awarded a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter in the New Year’s Honours list.

But 2021 showed that the working-class can fight back and win.
A rash of strikes has taken place including locally on the bins in Derbyshire , amongst JustEat delivery drivers and B&Q warehouse workers. 
 We will need more of such struggles and on a bigger scale if we are to smash the Tories in 2022.
We have also seen mass resistance on the streets against climate catastrophe, racism and attacks on LGBTQI people. 

Come along to our meeting - which will report back on discussions at  the SWP's National Conference which takes place in early January - to discuss how we can build resistance to the Tories and their corrupt system.

We listened to our residents. Of the 1752 residents that sent testimony to our County Council for last Friday's special session, 75% supported extension of our mask mandate. We heard from many who need us to wear masks to keep their children and immunocompromised loved ones safe.

We listened to the majority of our County Council who voted 4-3 to extend the mask mandate to protect the health of our residents. I was disappointed in the decision by three of our Councilmembers to reject the pleas of hospitals, business owners, and residents.

Coffee Hour will be held outside after the service, and a Virtual Coffee Hour is available on Zoom for those worshipping from home.

The opinion by Congressman Vern Buchanan (R-FL16) captioned “We must address the challenges we face in 2022” in the Sarasota Herald Tribune, Jan. 9, 2022, skews priorities.

Buchanan says not a word about the continuing pandemic and escalating infections, hospitalizations and deaths.  With the Omicron variant spreading rapidly, the United States is averaging over 500,000 new Covid-19 cases a day, higher than at any previous point, and Florida is in the vanguard 

Buchanan also fails to appreciate the broader healthcare crisis and the need for quality, affordable healthcare for all.  Buchanan voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times, with no viable substitute.  Moreover, with eight of the ten oldest Congressional districts (including FL16) in Florida, he voted repeatedly to turn Medicare into a “premium support”/vouchers system and to cut health funding.  He has also consistently opposed choice and women’s interests, voting against the Women’s Health Protection Act, Paycheck Fairness Act and Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.

Nor does Buchanan recognize that our democratic republic too is ailing.  Spurred by exhortations by the then-president to “Stop the Steal” and “Fight Like Hell,” thousands of armed rioters stormed the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021 and at least five people died as a result.  Nevertheless, Buchanan was among Republicans boycotting the Special Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack and declining to join the Congressional commemoration a year later.  Moreover, 52 restrictive voter laws passed in various states in 2021, but Buchanan is unconcerned over efforts to subvert elections and civil rights by voter suppression and gerrymandering.  He most recently voted nay on the Voter Rights Advancement Act.

While Buchanan does appreciate that “it’s the economy stupid,” he fails to offer viable suggestions.  Obviously, inflation and consumer prices have spiked way too high, but at least unemployment has dropped below 4% and other economic indicators have improved significantly.  Meanwhile, Buchanan’s own, selfish economic priority has been to vote for and tout the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with 80% or so of benefits going to corporations and individuals in the top 1%.

On deficits and debt, Buchanan hypes his proposal to amend the United States Constitution to require a balanced federal budget.  While the idea of balanced budgets is itself appealing, such an amendment would deprive federal policymakers of essential flexibility to address national security and economic emergencies.

On the environment, one looks in vain for any reference to climate change.  Extreme weather events in 2021, many exacerbated by climate change, set new records around the world.  Time is short to forestall a global catastrophe.  As to other environmental issues, Buchanan holding a roundtable on red tide and working to protect manatees and other species are noble efforts.  But these do not compensate for ignoring climate science.

One could go on and on about “challenges” Buchanan wholly or partially disregards.  On foreign policy, yes the Biden administration bungled the withdrawal from Afghanistan; but rather than this being the “biggest foreign policy disaster in a generation,” it got us out of the longest war in U.S. history.  On law enforcement, yes crime is skyrocketing, “defund the police” is a ridiculous slogan and the vast majority of our first responders are brave and honorable; but there are abuses, many discriminatory, that must be remedied.  And yes our porous southern border is of great concern, as are all kinds of drug trafficking; but an ugly wall of rusting steel has not proven effective.

To end where Buchanan began, asserting that “Americans have seemingly never been more divided” than under President Joe Biden is absurd.  Remember the lies of the last presidency, culminating in an insurrection?"

Most theorizing about reparations for slavery and colonialism treats it as a social justice project. The focus is on making amends in the present—characterizing reparations as reconciliatory justice—or on remedying historical wrongs by making restitution for past harms. Come learn about a third approach rooted in a hopeful view of the future from Dr. Olúfemi O. Táíwò, a Georgetown philosopher who earned a following among Profs and Pints audiences for his thought-provoking talks on race, class, and environmental concerns.

Dr. Táíwò will start by giving us a thorough grounding in the debates over the reconciliation- and restitution-based approaches to reparations. Then he’ll offer us a new case for reparations that he calls the “constructive” view because it is future-oriented and engaged in building a better social order.

Professor Táíwò’s approach, outlined in depth in his upcoming book, has distributive justice at its core, arguing that those who have inherited the moral liabilities for past injustices should bear a larger share of the costs of building a more equitable world. It tackles the most pressing issue of our day, climate change, head-on, by linking tried-and-true aspects of reparations justice, like cash payouts to descendants of slavery, with unexpected objectives such as divestment from fossil fuels and investment in community control over food, energy, and housing systems.

In contrast to many Profs and Pints talks that focus on the central ideas of the past, this talk by Dr. Táíwò will pull his audience up to the front lines of a current debate and offer them a new framework for understanding and evaluating proposals to deal with the crises of our day.

1. Clearly, the massive, rapid, Pandemic deficit spending 2019-21 resulted in painful levels of inflation. 
2. America's infrastructure spending has been deficient for decades 
3. Our recent (last 2 decades) record of infrastructure spending has been fraught  with red tape, waste, and costly delays . Take California's high speed rail project as an example. 
4. Removing over regulation and accelerating needed infrastructure modernization will save trillions of dollars and be good for the environment. Massive failures, like the California example, will kill the desire to invest in the future. 
5. CBO projections of future deficit levels are almost always underestimates, when the projection period is longer than 5 years. Why? Because the CBO, by law, uses average economic conditions as the basis for their estimates . Any period of time that includes a recession demonstrates deficits far in excess of CBO estimates. The US has had a major economic downturn about every 10 years for the las 40 years. . 
6. Rapid, efficient infrastructure improvement will promote more painful inflation, unless it is accompanied by serious deficit reduction , in the form of cuts to government spending,  that doesn't substantially contribute to future economic growth. 

NOW, SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

The choice the American people have made for the last 50 years has been to spend money on themselves and not on a better future world for their children. 
This works for the rich, who can still buy a decent future for their kids, but leaves the children of average Americans in the lurch. 
Each side of our divided political universe possesses some gut instincts that point us in the right direction. 

Trump supporters were correct that we need to remove unnecessary government intrusion  into Americans' lives . As pointed out above, only by removing over-regulation  can we build the America of  the future and make America great again. 
But many conservatives are willfully ignorant about past governmental success stories, with the exception of those involving the military. This  blinds them  to the potential for making investments in the future that involve the government. 

Progressives are correct that the government can play and has played a critical role in  making America a better place. Civil rights, social security, the interstate highway system and basic science research leading to the Covid vaccine, massively improved farming techniques and the internet are just a few examples. But progressive idealists can also become overly self- indulgent , and put too much faith in centralized control, resulting in massive debt, a bloated , wasteful, overly intrusive government that stifles  liberty and economic vitality. This is something conservatives point out to their liberal adversaries all the time.

We all have something to learn from each other. Instead of always fighting one another, maybe we should pause and consider that no one has all the answers. If we listen,  we may find part of the answer from the people we usually disagree with. That is the path to Making America Great Again. In the words of my favorite cartoon character,  ""We Are Groot"""

But I have serious reservations about mandatory vaccinations. I do not support Govt's policy of mandatory NHS vaccination and more importantly, the narrative Sajid Javid is pushing  in order to force through this policy. My reasons are as follows:

1 ) Informed Consent is a core pillar of modern medical ethics. It took over 30 years to be developed after analysing through the atrocities of the Holocaust that were specifically committed in the name of medical experiments. To undermine informed consent would be to undermine modern medicinal practice. Will we be making treatment for mandatory for Hep B and HIV as those pose a huge threat to the public as well? 

2) This narrative that Sajid Javid has used about unvaccinated staff posing a danger to patients has  NO substantial data behind it and he, being a politician, sat with his media advisors after getting owned by Dr Steve James and came up with this  line.That interaction was almost the end for his hopes of leading the Conservative Party someday and he had to come out in the media with a counter narrative.  I have many colleagues who are not vaccinated but are some of the most dedicated healthcare professionals. The idea that all these staff are now ""a danger"" to patients, when they were all "" a blessing"" in the first lockdown, with no vaccines, reeks of hypocrisy. I do medicine and politics and my experience in public health has taught me, both are intertwined, but this narrative is full of pitfalls and can erode public trust in medical staff. 

3) The above two reasons should be good enough to pause and cancel the introduction of mandatory vaccination irrespective of job profile. With the waiting list so long, will losing >70000 valuable, trained and dedicated staff help in any way?

4) If we are opening the country up again, people then can catch Covid from anyone. What is the whole point of making a scapegoat out of Healthcare professionals? Could you not get Covid from the cashier at the till or someone serving you at a restaurant or a bar?

5) The UK is introducing Paxlovid from February, the drug which can reduce hospitalisation and deaths by 88% if infected with Covid . Why are we then introducing such draconian measures for NHS staff?

This govt policy must have a review. I know the whole political spectrum is busy with one thing only right now but we must not ignore the ramifications, once this policy is implemented. I have no problem with an annual Covid vaccine(although we must be careful about vaccine fatigue if we introduce 12 weekly vaccines which one company once suggested if i am not mistaken). Before any idiot tries to portray me as anti-vax, I was completely vaccinated according to WHO guidelines while growing up in Bangladesh and  before starting for the NHS, I had voluntarily got vaccinated with the additional ones I was eligible for at the time as UK has an expanded vaccination programme and for the last 5 years, I have diligently taken all my flu vaccines annually.I am as pro-vaccination as anyone can get but I do not believe in compulsion. Pro-vaccination should not mean mandatory  vaccination.  If I supported mandatory vaccinations, I would have gone to China, not the West.

Say #NoToMandatoryVaccination"

Communities helping communities is the goal. She has partnered with StrongHearts Native Helpline, Indigenous Peoples Movement, Unicorn Riot, Black Visions Collective, Covid-19 Navajo Relief, Black and Missing Foundation and many more.

Although her creative passion for helping communities is at the forefront, she possesses a Doctorate in Education with a focus on Organizational Development/Leadership.

Portsmouth City UNISON is calling on employers and funders to boost the pay of care workers to at least the Living Wage of £9.90 per hour, an increase of over £1,900 a year for the lowest paid.

Across the country five million people are still paid below the real Living Wage. Two-thirds of them are women, as women dominate careers that are notoriously underpaid and undervalued.

In the context of cuts to Universal Credit, soaring household bills, and empty promises of levelling up and a high wage economy, the real Living Wage offers an important benchmark.

Chair of Portsmouth City UNISON branch Jon Woods said:

""Social care workers have put their lives on the line during the covid pandemic delivering highly skilled personal care and support, yet they are amongst the lowest paid. No wonder there is a crisis in social care when you can be paid more for flipping burgers and pulling pints than for looking after the most vulnerable people in society. Social care employers, Councils and Central government must step up to the plate to fund and implement the living wage now."""

I would like to thank the vast number of residents who reached out and urged me to run again. It was very humbling to say the least.

I would be lying if I didn’t say the last two years on this Select Board have been challenging. Not only has COVID presented its unique challenges, but the ability for the Select Board to focus on what is truly important to the town has been impacted as well. It’s time for us to focus on things, in addition to the ongoing pandemic, that affect the daily lives of Billerica residents: affordable/elderly housing, improving town infrastructure, economic development, preserving open space, and improving our support for seniors being among them.

I am running for re-election to ensure residents, employees, and small business owners in Billerica have someone advocating for them. I am YOUR representative on this Board and, if elected, will continue to work tirelessly to ensure we are always doing the right thing."

I also did a Masters from Barts in Public Health and during those 2 phases, I was introduced with a cornerstone of UK and EU medical ethics called ""Informed Patient Consent/Choice(IPC)."" 

Now let me make absolutely clear, if you are offered the vaccine, you should take it. I have seen mortality and morbidity due to Covid and I will always ADVISE taking the vaccine. But I DO NOT support a vaccine mandate. IPC is an essential pillar of General Medical Council and EU Medical Council and it is a novel Western concept that took ages to develop after the horrors of the medical experiments that were  carried out during the holocaust and by Japanese scientists in China, Korea and Philipines. The way countries like Germany, Austria, Netherlands and other EU countries are mandating vaccines is an affront to IPC amd undermines the most enlightened medical ethics in the 21st century. 

It is also opening up a can of worms in the field of medical ethics. Will HIV and Hepatitis-B treatments be made mandatory in future as they have the chance of mass spread in multiple ways? Where do we draw the line?

In the end, all I can hope is the UK govt refrains from further lockdowns and do not impose a vaccine mandate.

The bad news is that it's more contagious. The good news is that mRNA vaccines work against death and hospitalization. COVID may soon become endemic in some parts of the world. 

Not in China, where Xi Jinping's zero-COVID approach faces its toughest test to date with omicron. Why? Because China lacks mRNA jabs, and so few Chinese people have gotten COVID that overall protection is very low.

Get ready for a wave of lockdowns that'll severely disrupt the world's second-largest economy — just a month out from the Beijing Winter Olympics.

That could spell disaster for Beijing, Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, tells Ian Bremmer on this week's episode of GZERO World. Still, he says zero COVID remains popular with most Chinese people.

If things get really bad, though, Huang believes China will pivot to living with the virus, especially as the cost of keeping zero COVID in the age of omicron becomes too high. He thinks that's the right move for Xi.

Indeed, Huang expects China to start reversing course soon after the Games, and when the pandemic becomes endemic in other parts of the world. Beijing will throw in the towel on zero tolerance in 1-2 years, max.

Also, a look at vaccine incentives around the world. Do prizes like cows and brothel visits actually convince holdouts to get the jab?"

Rebeka, a daughter of Michigan

We've seen a lot of time as the first generation on American soil.  Many new generations have been born in the families of those of us who one day started living in this country as green card holders through immigration visa system or student visa or other means.  At the same time, many of the children who came to the United States at a young age have grown up today.
 
The day may not be far off when these children of ours will gradually establish themselves in the mainstream of this country and be able to assert themselves as ideal citizens, as pure Americans in various important offices, in business, in politics and even in state responsibilities.  As we can see that beautiful dream has already begun to be realized in many places.  Some people's children today have taken the top seats in the mainstream American corporate office, business and IT sectors with their talents.
 
Rebeka Islam was born in Bangladesh.  She moved the United State of America with her parents when she was five years old. Rebeka Islam grew up in the town of Hamtramck, Michigan. Her primary education was in Detroit Public School.
 
 While in high school, Rebeka began working for her community.  As a volunteer she has worked on various social welfare projects at APIA VOTE-MI and the American Red Cross.  Fascinated by her determination and leadership, the American Red Cross honored her with the Youth Leadership Award in 2010.
 
 After finishing high school, Rebeka completed her undergraduate education, majoring in biology and psychology at Wayne State University.  While studying in undergrad she started working as a community organizer for APIA VOTE-MI.  While working for APIA VOTE-MI, Rebeka experienced first-hand how lack of opportunities and lack of awareness coupled with apathetic attitude from leaders was leaving her community behind. That experience helped her grow a strong desire to involve herself in community service, so that she can help bring positive changes in communities of immigrants, and minorities.
 
To improve the situation, Rebeka used her experience to develop a strong desire to work for immigrants and minorities through community services.  Working tirelessly to address issues related to civil rights, economic empowerment, housing, public health and the right to vote.
 
With hard work and perseverance, Rebeka is now the Executive Director of APIA VOTE-MI.  In addition, she serves as a board director at the Michigan State League of Women's Voters, American Citizens for Justice, and the Washington, D.C. - Voter Empowerment Project. 
 
Rebeka and her organization played a key role in increasing the AAPI voter turnout in the 2020 election.  For the 2020 election, APIA VOTE-MI registered a large number of new Asian Americans to vote.  Not only that, working with the Secretary of State's office, her organization has helped translate voting materials into many Asian languages, including Bengali, to ensure that the immigrant community has access to multiple translated languages.
 
 When the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world, Rebeka and her organization began working tirelessly to help the AAPI community.  At first, they distributed free personal protective equipment among the people in the community.  Then, APIA VOTE-MI Distributed 
covid-19 testing and covid-19 vaccines through trusted messengers. Moreover, they continue to serve the people of the community by distributing care packages and food staples during these difficult times.  For her hard work and dedication, the Michigan Governor's Office recently awarded her the Michigan Hero’s Award.
 
During the pandemic, anti-Asian hate crimes increased exponentially.  Six women of Asian descent were shot dead in Atlanta, Georgia. Rebeka organized multiple rallies to protest the inhumane treatment of the Asian community.  Hundreds of people from all walks of life took part in the protests to show solidarity and support with the AAPI community.
 
Rebeka is an active member of the Michigan Redistricting Commission's Outreach and Communications Committee.  Rebeka worked day and night to bring together people from different communities and through them recommends the Redistricting Commission to keep Banglatown in one district.  As a result of Rebeka’s leadership and the hard work of her organization, the Michigan Redistricting Commission in 2021 modified their maps to keep Michigan's Banglatown in one district.  Edward Woods, director of communications and outreach at the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, recognized Rebecca for her tireless work and presented her as a role model for grassroots leaders.
 
 In her spare time, Rebeka enjoys volunteering with various local campaigns and interfaith organizations.  She loves to travel, and likes to spend time with family."

According to the International Energy Agency's latest market report, global oil supplies jumped by 1.4 million barrels per day in October, with the United States accounting for half that increase as Gulf of Mexico output recovered from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida in August.

The Paris-based agency said it expected a further boost of 1.5 million barrels per day over November and December, with the United States forecast to provide more of that increase than any other country.

""The world oil market remains tight by all measures, but a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon,"" it said.

Prices for US and Brent crude oil are trading near six-week highs at $80.15 and $81.62 a barrel. That's left drivers in California paying a record $4.68 per gallon for gasoline, according to AAA. Europe hasn't escaped either. Prices hit record highs in the United Kingdom last month.

The IEA said it expected output to increase in the next two months despite the OPEC+ group of oil producing countries declining appeals from US President Joe Biden to ramp up production beyond a planned monthly increment of 400,000 barrels per day.

The agency said it had raised its US output forecast by 300,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter and by 200,000 barrels per day on average in 2022, as high prices encourage higher output.

""That increase will go some way to meet rising demand, still recovering from the 2020 Covid slump,"" the report said, adding that refinery production was also on the rise again, following maintenance over autumn.

The agency raised its global gasoline demand forecast for the last quarter of 2021 by 250,000 barrels per day after seeing end-user demand ""on track to strengthen further"" over the rest of the year, as more countries open up to international travel, people become more mobile and Covid-19 vaccination campaigns pick up.

1. The Solar Eclipse in Sagittarius takes place on the 4th, marking a significant turning point for those with prominent placements in the 9º to 15º range of the Gemini/Sagittarius polarity. For most people, this eclipse may bring a feeling of time speeding up, hectic travel and shopping conditions, and the dismayed recognition of inflation. With the Sun and Moon opposing Black Moon Lilith and quincunx Uranus, watch out for trouble spots on the road, reckless or mentally unbalanced people, and those who talk endlessly without saying anything. This eclipse hits Joe Biden’s progressed Midheaven and Jill Biden’s Sun at 12º Gemini, so may bring some unexpected developments from the White House.

2. Mars enters Sagittarius on the 13th, marking a distinctive change in how people go about getting what they want. Our Inner Warrior becomes more open and direct than the subtle extreme designs of Mars in Scorpio. The next five weeks is a good time to enjoy projects and activities that bring enthusiasm, more engagement with others, and traveling experiences that take you out of normal routines. Mars’s change of signs is unusually noticeable due to its opposition to Ceres and the North Node. This configuration may bring a change of plans due to rapidly developing events, perhaps concerning health or the caretaking of children or elders.

3. Venus turns retrograde on the 19th while in Capricorn and conjunct Pluto. Since Venus is slowing down into its retrograde station, it remains very near Pluto from the 8th through 27th and delineates a timeframe when personal and business finances could use some major adjustments. This phase forces relationships centered around shared finances –including marriages – to take a serious look at what must be done to stay within budget and to achieve long-range goals. Be practical, take into account inflation, and avoid over-leveraging high risk-benefit projects. The US business/economic/financial cycle is due for a correction. Biden’s infrastructure plan may get bogged down in the details of how to pay for programs. 

4. The Winter Solstice on the 21st (11:00 am EST) takes place just three days before the Saturn-Uranus square, placing this dynamic front and center over the coming several months. One of the tightest aspects in this chart is Jupiter trine Hygeia (orb: 0º06’) which offers some favorable developments concerning the pandemic in the near future. Potential market turmoil can be seen in the conjunction between Venus retrograde and Pluto, plus Vesta near the Midheaven opposite Black Moon Lilith. Look for a fascinating celebrity marriage around this time (Mercury conjunct Juno). Political scandal, misinformation, and uncertainty are likely with Pallas conjunct Neptune and squaring the Midheaven for the chart set in Washington DC.

5. The third and final Saturn-Uranus square takes place on the 24th, completing this clash of titans. This outer planet duo has intensified our collective interactions in several historic ways, including the pandemic, how to deal with global warming, and social divisions along cultural and economic lines. Those with their Sun or other important placement at 10º to 12º of the fixed signs are most influenced by this particular Saturn-Uranus square. Saturn works hard for security within a social network (in Aquarius), while Uranus urges one to break away from habitual paths due to boredom, corruption, or toxicity. With growing covid infections, Uranus represents those who tout their personal right to not get vaccinated. Saturn in Aquarius urges precautions for the common good.

Not even knowing the language, Yakov humbly began working as a bartender at the famous Grossinger’s Catskill Resort in New York, where he was able to tell jokes each night after his shifts. As his English improved, he quickly grew in popularity. He would then make the move to Los Angeles where the owner of The Comedy Store, Mitzi Shore, took him under her wing.

His lovable view of life through the eyes of a poor immigrant captured the hearts of America. He soared to the top of the comedy world performing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and countless other television programs, including as a regular character on Night Court and the star of his very own show, named after his famous catch-phrase, “What a Country!” He branched out to the big screen where he starred in movies with Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, and Jack Nicholson to name a few. Still, one of his favorite achievements is obtaining his American citizenship in front of the Statue of Liberty in 1986. From his humble beginnings as a poor immigrant to living the American dream, Yakov has even performed for four U.S. Presidents and has been the main event for The White House Correspondents Dinner.

Yakov Smirnoff is a legendary comedian, a movie star, a best-selling author, and most recently, he has earned a doctorate degree from Pepperdine’s Graduate School of Education and Psychology. Living a life that’s as exciting as ever, Yakov has married his sweetheart, is currently touring the world doing stand-up, and even has his very own theater in Branson, Missouri. With the heart of a dreamer, Yakov Smirnoff has made the impossible possible and continues to inspire others with his message of love and laughter. Keep an eye out for his brand new podcast on ABC Radio, look for him at a theater near you, and stay tuned for what Dr. Yakov does next!"

Now, I'm here to tell you that the pandemic will end in the next few weeks.  I don't have a crystal ball, but just watch what happens in other countries.  Italy led our knowledge into the pandemic.  South Africa is telling us what will happen next.  Someone is South Africa got Covid and one of the coronaviruses that cause the common cold at once.  Both viruses invaded the same cell at the same time and their genetics got mixed up.  Sort of like Covid got the cold!!! The new virus, now known as Omicron, has part of SARS-CoV-2 and part of the routine cold virus.  It became much more infectious.  Within weeks, 2/3 of Delta infections have been replaced by Omicron and in the next couple of weeks, almost all Covid will be Omicron.  Nasty Delta will be gone. This rapid shift is now happening all over the world.  Why is this fantastic news? Omicron is like the common cold, less than the flu even.  People get a little sick, with almost no hospitalizations, and no deaths and no oxygen requirements, no intubations!  There is a slight uptick of people in hospitalized patients with Omicron but they are not there because of the virus, they just happen to have the virus when tested.  People who have had vaccines are protected.  People who have had Covid are protected.  Both vaccinated and previously Covid positive people can still get Omicron but nobody dies, gets hospitalized or requires oxygen!  Because this virus is infecting everyone it meets, the whole world will get it within the next few weeks and before March 2022 the pandemic will be over.  I still recommend all people over 60 even with no health problems, or anyone under 60 with medical conditions get your boosters. In light of this information, I pray that our politicians don't do anything crazy like shutting down businesses or schools, and remove the vaccine mandates which hurt businesses and people who need to work and our children in school.  Also remove the vaccine mandate for children!!!We will soon put this pandemic behind us and get back to glorious life. Much love ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏"

Like most metro regions, the Portland Tri-County area is facing multiple crises, from COVID to housing and homelessness. Yet 2021 brought considerable new resources and comprehensive, community-centered approaches to manage them. Metro Council President Lynn Peterson will share recent wins for the region, including expanded affordable housing, improved public garbage collection and a new nature park in Oregon City. She will focus on how Metro is responding to our homelessness crisis and the lasting impacts we can foresee as a result. Marcus Mundy, executive director of Coalition of Communities of Color, will moderate.

FULL REPORT >  https://bit.ly/3zXrHQC

Spiking Covid case counts as we ended 2021 reminded us all once again how vulnerable we remain to new variants of this terrible virus, no matter how badly we all wish to put it behind us and return to normal.  Still, extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus helped to propel the economy, corporate profits, and stock prices meaningfully higher this past year, capped by an 11.0% rise for the S&P 500 Index in the fourth quarter.  For the year, the S&P 500 was up 28.7%.

We continue to believe a proper balance of high-quality cyclical and secular growth stocks in our Clients’ portfolios is appropriate at this time given the many uncertainties related to Covid, fiscal and monetary policy, and bond yields.  In fact, a rotation may have already begun, favoring quality growth stocks trading at reasonable prices with above-average earnings growth.  Any change in market leadership away from the speculative areas supported by extraordinary monetary accommodation should be advantageous to our Clients’ portfolios.  Although we may experience increased bouts of market volatility as massive stimulus measures begin to wane, we remain constructive on the investment landscape and have confidence in those stocks whose positions were strengthened as a result of this pandemic and are therefore poised to perform well as the economy fully reopens and returns to a more normal state.

They will both put the educational attainment of nearly 200k HISD students as their top priority, speak out plainly about not running down CRT or other ""rabbit trails"" and stay on public policy that makes a positive difference in educating our school kids!
 
The HISD Board of Trustees has to leave the world of lawsuits and board corruption behind and start making the decision that can help close the COVID-19 gap in education test scores. Only 33% of all HISD students are testing at grade level, which means the task is enormous. I believe Trustees Baker and Wade bring that view to the board and new leadership as well.
 
Also, had a chance to swear-in my old friend, David Wilson, back on to the Houston Community College Board. Trustee Wilson gave an important set of remarks commenting on all the other board members’ backgrounds, and what they can accomplish together. My brief remark was that I'm glad he's back on the board, on behalf of all the taxpayers of Harris County. To shed some insight, the HCC Board has lost a couple of Trustees due to Federal law enforcement cases, and they too need to leave the world of lawsuits and corruption behind and focus on student educational attainment.
 
These have been important elections for folks with conservative principles getting involved back into Houston education positions.

🗓 My team and I have been excited to meet many of you at your home and in your neighborhood and we have had great conversations about issues and concerns that you care about it.

I’m glad that we have been able to help residents of District 2.

✅ Such as helping to put speed humps, streetlight, neighborhood clean ups, food banks and hosting covid 19 vaccination clinics to name a few things that we were able to accomplish in 2021. 

🤝 Imagine what we can accomplish together when I become the next county council member for District 2.

⚽️ As I often reminded my northwestern High School Soccer Team on their journey to winning a state championship, there is no I in team and that working together you can accomplish great things. 

🙏🏻 Together we will accomplish so much more and we will move District 2 forward.

🔊 As always, My promise is to listen to the residents and their needs. 

If you want to join our team, please visit us at victorramirez.com and remember.

What is going on in the property market?

I think last year took so many of us by surprise. A continuation of covid and the challenges and excuses it offers. Excuses as it seems so many industries used covid as a means of explaining away bad service and delays.
The challenges however were more evident. Whilst the travel, hospitality and retail industry were slaughtered, other sectors seemed to thrive. Car sales and car prices increased as an example.

Whilst house sales numbers may not have increased, the value of property and the eventual sale price certainly did. Even from what seemed like a tremendous “peak” in 2020!
 
Estate Agents had to adapt to challenges on staff sickness and knock on effects on opening hours. We had to inform ourselves and the market about the ever changing legislation, often different from country to country within the British Isles.

We had to adapt to the ever increasing offers but bear in mind that these offers often came within the first few days. So a decision was taken individually on every home, for every client on whether we take a substantial offer or hold for closing. This of course led to confused vendors and angry buyers who were either annoyed at losing out or being blown away in a closing date.
 
Despite all this we felt Regents were best suited to coping and adapting. A small, professional company can react and turn quicker than a “slow corporate”. We could give the best advice for our area immediately. Rather than a corporate, one fits all compromise that may have suited no one.
 
THIS IS WHY WE WON THE GOLD AWARD FOR DUNFERMLINE AND VOTED SILVER (SECOND BEST ESTATE AGENT) IN THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND.
 
What then for 2022?
 
We see the same trends continuing as the market is “fuelled” not necessarily by lockdown restrictions, Brexit or indeed a need and want to spend on property due to savings created by lockdown. 

The driving factor was and remains, demand and supply. There are too little available homes for the current buyer demand. Too few bungalows and property’s with gardens for the number of people desperate to purchase. Too many flats in short supply for the “army” of first time buyers and buy to let investors.
 
So we are as willing and able as last year to repeat our extraordinary performance, in customer care, in adaptation and ability to achieve the best outcome for all that give us their trust.

We finish this year with a bit of the same uncertainty with which we started it. But the same as in 2020, by pulling together as a community, we did the right things to ease the suffering of the moss vulnerable and we can be proud of that.

Here’s a selection of pictures of what we achieved in 2021: community litter picks, remembering and enduring Covid, securing massive investment in our town, commemorating brave youngsters, supporting veterans, supporting businesses, enjoying the World Cup at Newton Sports Club, working with Newton Deli and Victoria to deliver food and supplies to the most vulnerable, helping Newton Community Centre to deliver their huge Christmas Toy Drive with the support of other groups such as Newton-Le-Willows Rotary Club and Newton Bgc. Along with other great support from Riddling Rack, Tesco Superstore and Wilko. Excellent work from Newton le Willows Sea Cadets to support our Remembrance Day. And endless groups of volunteers to help with local groups and sports clubs. And loads of others I’ve no doubt missed.

I had the honour of an honour. Which pales in comparison to the pride of you putting your trust in me for my third election in a row with our biggest majority since 1973 in Newton ward. I’ve been a Councillor for ten years this year and will continue to fight for investment and opportunity in NLW.

And I’m immensely proud of Newton and Earlestown Community Group receiving the highest award a community group can receive in the UK; the Queens Award for Voluntary Service from HM The Queen. 

2022 will bring some big news: a new school at Red Bank. Opportunity at Parkside. Work to begin in Earlestown Town Hall. Regeneration of Earlestown Town Centre and Train Station to begin. Investment in our parks. Support for our High Street. 

So onwards, together, into whatever 2022 will bring. Knowing we can tackle it as a community of doers, not held back by whingers.

The Violence Against Women Act has been one of the cornerstones of America’s response to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking for the past quarter-century. Every time Congress has reauthorized VAWA, they have strengthened it to improve protections and access to safety and justice for all survivors. VAWA is now four years past due for reauthorization, and it is time to renew it with modest but vital improvements. In the COVID-19 era, we cannot afford to maintain the status quo or, even worse, to roll back hard-fought gains. I call on all our senators to prioritize the Senate introduction and passage of a bipartisan Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022, that meets the identified needs of survivors and their communities. #VAWA4ALL

Breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated are expected, but vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. Evidence suggests fully vaccinated people who become infected with the Omicron variant can still spread the virus to others so use caution around family and friends who are at high risk. All FDA-approved or authorized vaccines are expected to be effective against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. 

Additionally, Omicron has been associated with higher rates of false negative rapid tests. If you are worried about an exposure or have symptoms and your rapid test is negative, get a PCR test also.

What else can you do?
-
Go get your booster, especially if you are >65 years of age or have risk factors. Use common sense and avoid close contact with anyone who has active symptoms. If you are going to be in a crowd of people (concert, sporting event, etc.), wear a mask.

There are also fewer staff members to care for patients because many healthcare workers are themselves sick with COVID. Healthcare workers say staffing levels were a big problem before the pandemic, and now they're asking #WAleg for safe staffing standards. 

It’s not enough to hire more staff, healthcare workers say, if we don’t have a plan to retain them. “It is really, really important that people who come into this industry know that they're going to have these safe staffing standards, so they don't get burnt out and leave. We have to start with [these standards] because this is the only way that we'll be able to get more people into the workforce,” said Jane Hopkins, a registered nurse and the executive vice president of SEIU Healthcare 1199NW."

“I pretty much came to believe that it was meant to be. And so I went ahead and wrote my living will, prepared for my disposal when I was gone, wrote letters to my friends, and talked to my family. And I just said, ‘You know, it's not that big of a deal. My time is over.’”
 
“I was diagnosed with end stage [terminal] liver disease caused by chemicals I was exposed to while repairing boats and not taking proper safety precautions. The doctors weren’t optimistic. My liver was deteriorating and I was in agonizing pain. I visited the hospital several times a week to drain the waste my liver couldn’t process, and the doctors told me I would need a liver transplant to survive.”
 
“I had more than once begged my dad to bring me one of my pistols and one of my bullets so that I could go ahead and get it over with – the pain and problems of having a terminal illness. I had already taken the time to fill out a living will with a DNR so that there wouldn't be any attempts to try to bring me back or put me on life support. “
 
“I got so bad, I was actually trying to get into a nursing home because there was just no way that I could live on my own anymore, and when I got to a nursing home in November 2016, I was on compassionate care through hospice, and I was not expected to live through Christmas of that year.”

“Although I was on a transplant list, even if I got approved, they couldn’t do it then. So either I was going to flat out die or I was going to get a transplant.”

“That was five years ago, neither have happened.”
 
“Death was knocking at my door. I was given about a month to live, and then suddenly made a miraculous turn. My liver started to regenerate. Livers will do that, but my doctors did not expect mine to regenerate since it was operating at about 20%. Inexplicably to my doctors, my liver today is operating at about 70%. While most of my doctors won’t admit it, I’m pretty sure I know what’s behind my second lease on life.”
 
“I was on all these kinds of harmful narcotic painkillers, and Xanax, but opioids are bad for your liver because your liver has to process the trash out of your system and opiates are trash. I didn’t want to be on them. But I had a friend, who knew I was in pain and wanted to see if she could help ease my pain in the final weeks of my life. She’d pick me up from the nursing home, we’d drive somewhere, smoke a little marijuana, spend some time together, and returned to the nursing home.”
 
“You remember me mentioning how I wanted to die? Well, smoking marijuana removed my desire to accelerate my death. It helped me manage my expectations of what life is going to be like with a terminal illness. It helped me not only emotionally, but also medically.”
 
“My eyes and skin were initially yellow and sickly, and that suddenly changed. I was like, what the hell's going on? And my appetite changed, so I was able to eat some of my favorite foods again. Most of my doctors won’t admit it, but I’m certain. I did some research and I found out that it was possible marijuana could help regenerate liver cells. So I started to use marijuana more frequently.”
 
“Next thing we know, I’m well enough that I'm getting ready to move out of the nursing home and go to an assisted facility and hopefully progress from there back to living on my own completely. One doctor did say he thought marijuana played a positive role, and my nurse practitioner agreed as well. Recently my nurse practitioner took me off all the narcotics they were giving me, and she agreed that if it were not for cannabis, I would not be in the position I am now.”
 
“The owners of my nursing home knew about my situation. At first I would only smoke off campus, and never inside, so they didn’t care. But once COVID came, we couldn’t have visitors so I couldn’t go smoke with my friend. I was in pain and didn’t want to take narcotics. I felt my only option was to smoke inside. Again, the owners didn’t care, but they recently got new management that’s tied to a larger corporate entity who does not approve. The management invited me to voluntarily leave within 30 days, but the owners put that on hold to allow me to get my affairs in order. Much of the staff and patients actually voted for Initiative 65 last year, legalizing medical marijuana for patients with debilitating medical conditions, until the state Supreme Court struck it down.”
 
“When the initiative passed, everybody here got excited. We have residents who because of their different diseases or dementias, struggle every day. Lots of patients here agree that it will help ease pains, fears and erratic behavior.”
 
“I’m preparing to move out and found an assisted living facility that I’ll soon transition to. I’m hopeful that one day I’ll be able to live independently without any assistance and without fear of punishment. I should not be alive. I’ve been given a second chance at life, and I’m grateful for that.”
 
“I personally hope medical marijuana becomes law in Mississippi so I don't have to worry about going to jail for using something that is beneficial to me. If it weren't for cannabis, I wouldn’t be here today.”

When Donald Trump told an extremist group to “stand back and stand by,” or U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar posting an animated video of him decapitating a political opponent, they were using a relatively new kind of political communications strategy: implicit support for the use of violence against political enemies.

Increasingly common over the past five years and coming mainly from politicians and pundits on the far right at a time when America’s political climate has become more politicized and aggressive, implied support for political violence goes beyond the sort of spirited debate and disagreement that American democracy was founded upon. Does it represent just another form of political speech protected under the First Amendment, or does it pose a real danger? If the latter, what should be done about it?

Come hear such questions tackled by Dr. Kurt Braddock, who has conducted research on communication and terrorism for several national and international organizations, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of State, Public Safety Canada, the U.K. Home Office, and the United Nations Office of Counter Terrorism.

Professor Braddock will give us a firm grounding in the concept of “stochastic terrorism,” or political violence spawned by vague calls to violent action. Tapping into decades of research on communication and decision-making and accounts of specific violent acts inspired by implicit orders, he’ll show us that the threat posed by implicit calls to violence is real. Finally, he’ll discuss how we can fight the violence motivated by these statements while maintaining the sacrosanctity of the First Amendment.

With the threat of new political violence looming on the horizon even as Congressional hearings on the events of January 6, 2021 remain underway, his talk promises to give you a much more sophisticated understanding of recent events and a clearer sense of what might lie ahead for our nation.

After working for over a year, today, the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission adopted a new State House map using a fair, democratic, inclusive process. They officially passed the Hickory map (it's the green district below).

We have a winnable district – District 80 – centered around Kentwood, East Grand Rapids, Cascade Township and including southern precincts in Grand Rapids Township. It’s a district won by Biden and Peters in 2020 and by Whitmer, Nessel, Benson and Stabenow in 2018. It's an open seat (no incumbents), but, it will be a hard-fought general election campaign with a State House majority on the line.

To win this district, we need a Democratic nominee with a proven record of getting results for our community. Having served at the city and county level, I know what we need and how to get it done.

As your Kent County Commissioner, I have promoted public health and defended our healthcare professionals so they can protect everyone during the pandemic. I supported small businesses, non-profits, and schools with needed funds to support our community during Covid. I advanced the game-changing sustainable business park to divert trash from landfills, recover more reusable materials, and generate renewable energy from organic waste. I also helped pass and implement the Ready By Five proposal, which supports the health, development and education of young children here in Kent County.

In the State House, I will continue my record of getting us results. I pledge to support families, invest in education, care for our environment, grow good-paying jobs, build a welcoming and inclusive society, defend women’s access to reproductive healthcare, and protect our democracy.

The campaign is up and running and I hope you’ll join our team with a donation before the December 31st deadline. I hope you will consider contributing $25, $50, $100 or more at https://www.philskaggs.com/contribute

sooner than later none I agree at this point we have little choice considering the circumstances Some of the wounds we have suffered are unavoidable and others are the worst kind self inflicted wounds Because of FAKE news and lousy handing of this pandemic from day we are where we are today All the wrong people have been at the podium and the CDC has become a political organization Full stop I also understand the need for a balanced approach and dealing with a crisis of epic proportions However DO NOT tout science when you are making NON scientific decisions in order to try and balance the reality of what is needed at this time in the real world MILLIONS of people CHOSE their personal freedoms over being a patriotic American and doing the right thing We now have of people currently in hospitalized with COVID are the UNVACCINATED and OVERWHELMING the healthcare system costing the taxpayers billions with a B in All the while a FREE and readily available vaccine was and is available to prevent this calamity LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN A FREE AND READILY AVAILABLE VACCINE WAS AND IS AVAILABLE TO PREVENT THIS CALAMITY Yes I am not ignorant enough to not admit that occasionally a person vaccinated will unfortunately get admitted to the hospital with COVID despite their best efforts Yes that is a thing Nothing is full proof With that being said what do we mean when we say overwhelm the healthcare system what does that look like It means the doctors nurses cleaning people transport crews greeters EMTs nursing aides cooks lab technicians and on and on cannot sustain this tragedy at the level of response needed to take care of people Don t worry at all about hospital administration which includes now doctors and nurses now because they ran for the hills and were the first ones in line for a vaccine under the tent They even got their friends and families vaccinated before it was even available to the public at large They ll be just fine Why Because they are thieves of the worst kind So what systems have to deal with is not only COVID patients but the run through traffic that walks through our ERs every single day Especially this time of year People who have heart attacks strokes kidney or heart failure cancer related issues trauma and so on What do you think There are endless hospitals that go at your call in a good year that are just waiting open arms to care for an additional hundreds or thousands of patients in a moments notice WHERE do you put those sick people when there is no where to put them and NO ONE to truly care for them Don t think for one second that during wave people in hospitals didn t die of unintended neglect because they did We barely had PPE let alone a room reservation So since we need to get healthcare teams back working again ASAP to take care of the country in their times of most need SCREW THEM again Come on back early Let s overwork under pay the people who SELFLESSLY put themselves in HARMS way every single day to care for other citizens in our UN Unified country No problem come on back in essential workers Nurses already had nursing to patient ratios that were ridiculous to begin because hospitals are cheap to pay for more nurses They would rather ensure their salaries and make cuts to the true essentials in essential workers WHO do you think is really caring for patient during this pandemic Thats right NURSES Arguably the backbone and the glue that holds hospital units together all day everyday But hey you re not infectious anymore Why Because we say so Maybe not infectious but maybe so That s what I want an overworked recently sick amazing ICU nurse that may be shedding virus taking care of my mother in the ICU when she is deathly sick with something other than COVID only to contract COVID Really Is that where we are Guess we are so desperate we have no choice And you know what We do it We will do it Because we have a conscience We have a heart We have love for those that we don t know and have never met because we love what we do and because we believe in a purpose greater than ourselves So IF we can We will be there for YOU AMERICA So back to the science Honestly though based on what Everyone speaks to science They are speaking antiquated science at best To me it s all smoke and mirrors What data regarding OMICRON is currently available to guide this reduced quarantine time What What we know about Omicron is that it is the most contagious strain we have seen this far So contagious that it wiped out Delta in a matter of WEEKS to take the number spot on the list This new goal post shift is based on data from prior strains of COVID not OMICRON This is unacceptable In my neighborhood it s called BS Just be forthright and truthful It s really that simple We can handle the truth because we already know what and why you are doing it Even the biggest advocates of vaccinations masking distancing etc will begin to turn on you Get a spine Here s the truth Most testing is nonsense The rapid test is a waste of time Too early you ll miss it days later repeat it or get a PCR and it s positive In the meantime you ve infected likely tens of other people in your circle When people are sick they know When they aren t they aren t Yes you can be a carrier no doubt and be without symptoms BUT most people walking around have no idea they are and most aren t testing themselves So unless you are TESTING EVERYONE It s virtually useless The only role in my eyes for testing at this point is TEST to RETURN to work That makes sense The numbers of currently infected are grossly underestimated By millions Why Because we don t have a testing infra structure never did Almost everyone has either had is infected symptoms or not or will get infected with some form of coronavirus of the COVID variant variety The numbers that get posted and all the news media attention are INACCURATE AT BEST and probably underestimate by millions of people in this country alone Right now we are

• Feb. 3, 7-8 p.m. central time
• In-person and live-streamed 

Registration is required. Register to get details about the live stream.

The words of the Negro Spiritual that opens our service this month tell us “God’s gonna trouble the water.” We gather in February, during African-American History Month, to lament together the stark reality of racism in our world, our country and our local community. 

Perhaps you have never prayed bout racism or heard it named aloud in the context of the church. The way we speak about the wounds of racism matters. Words are powerful tools of communication and creativity. We use words to create and we use words to destroy. We must recognize the many ways, intentionally and unintentionally, that our words and our absence of words, contribute to racial division and recognize what is needed to heal these divides.

Our words affect our actions and through our prayer for transformation, may the Holy Spirit inspire us toward action for racial justice. 

God’s word in sacred scripture is very clear that all people are equal. 

Download a program for the service here: Taizé Service Worship Aid for February 3, 2022. https://www.pbrenewalcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Taize-Service-for-February-3-2022-Worship-Aid-1.pdf

The event will be live-streamed for our many friends who cannot be with us physically.

COVID Protocols: If you are joining us in person, we require participants to show proof of vaccination. We require masks at all times indoors and practice social distancing.

What is Taizé?

Taizé prayer is practiced throughout the world. It is a meditative candle-lit form of community prayer that includes simple chants sung repeatedly, silence and prayers of praise and intercession. In prayer, we enter the silence, stilling the mind, opening the heart, surrendering to the action of the Spirit ever molding us into the image of Christ. The candles used in the service symbolize the presence of the risen Christ, who conquered darkness and sin and offers new life to all humankind. 

Taizé Prayer comes from an ecumenical, monastic community in France and has spread to numerous spots around the world. 

From the depths of the human condition, a secret aspiration rises up. Today many are thirsting for the essential reality: an inner life, signs of the Invisible. Nothing is more conducive to communion with the living God than meditative common prayer. When the mystery of God becomes tangible through the simple beauty of symbols, when it is not smothered by too many words, then a common prayer awakens us to heaven’s joy on earth.

We’ve already had to cancel most surgeries – delaying care that would help someone live a better, healthier life. As long as cases remain high, there will be even more serious impacts on access to lifesaving healthcare. Maybe even your own. 

You can make a difference. Here’s how:

💉💉 Get vaccinated. Many COVID-19 patients in our hospitals are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated. 

💉 💉 💉 If you are vaccinated, get a booster. It’s the best protection against needing to be hospitalized from the omicron variant. 
 
😷  Upgrade your mask. If available, use an N95, KN95, KF94 or surgical mask. Wear the most protective mask you can and make sure it fits well. 

👫🏽 👬🏽 👭🏽 Avoid crowded indoor spaces. Gatherings will be safer in well-ventilated spaces. 

🏥  Save the ER for emergencies. Do not go to the emergency room for treatment of mild illness or for COVID-19 testing. 

👩🏽‍⚕️ 💊  Do not delay routine healthcare visits. Talk to your primary care provider about routine medical care to help avoid needing more advanced medical care in the future. 

We can't get through this without you.

In the UK one of our biggest assets is the National Health Service. The public choose to protect it, serve it and nurture it. 

Everyone born and raised in the UK will have utilised the NHS at some point or even just visiting the UK and were unfortunately in need of medical attention. NHS nurses are God’s angels ready to dispense a much needed joke to ease your discomfort and stress or shield you at your most vulnerable. Comforting a child at bed time who is away from their parents for the first time with a cup of hot milk and then marvelling and rejoicing at their recovery. 

When one mature male patient  had to have a catheter put in a delicate region his horror was obvious  but the NHS nurse had a way of calming him down and getting past his male ego and he was like a little boy again in her professional hands ready to do as she said and quickly eased into a routine. 

Marie Curie Nurses help people living with terminal illness and who want to be cared for and die in the dignity of their own home peacefully. They will do daily spot checks and co-ordinate times with family members to administer pain relief and medicine. It’s a tireless affair turning up rain or shine to make sure your patients who rely on you are cared for. They don’t care if you are a saint or a sinner or even refuse to rally their cause.  Rich or poor everyone is treated the same under their care and supervision. 

Then of course there was our own Prime Minster, Boris Johnson when suffering from Covid-19 it was the NHS nurses who rallied around him and kept an all night and day vigil in his most dangerous hours. Try standing for one hour on the same spot let alone an all night vigil, it’s tiring and hard work. 

What drives such a selfless service of care because they are not paid top dollar, they are only making enough to survive and a little more for reasonable extras. It’s certainly not money or blood ties. It’s a genuine desire to serve and protect their communities. 

Of course there are other great inspirational stories like the check out girl who must be in her late teens to early 20’s. Claire works  at a Tesco supermarket and as the familiar beep was sounding off as your items that you can’t live without were going down the till she began to look guilty and forlorn. It was the first week of the pandemic in March 2020 when the whole world was frightened about this unknown disease and had thought there was a potential the world could end. All what seems a far away thought now but at the time it seemed very, very real because little was known about Covid and the consequences it could herald. Claire explained she felt ‘guilty about going to work today’. The customer was glad she had attended afterall how would they get their lifeline groceries home to feed and sustain themselves? Claire explained her Mother had kept crying that morning when she had insisted she call in sick in the first lockdown because she was fearful for her daughter’s wellbeing in the face of an unknown virus. But Claire insisted she could not let work and customers down .... but deep down she was scared too. Claire was the epitome of grace and strength because she had a beautiful soul that shone like a beacon of light despite her neutral check out uniform. Her inner beauty far eclipsed any venerated heiress or celebrity. Turning up to work that day was an act of courage despite the emotional turmoil she faced inwards and outwards from her loved ones. 

She is not the only one, there is the post man who would wear gloves in the first pandemic frightened to get close to you and would hastily leave your life line of parcels at your door in a hurry once he realised you were aware you had parcels. Those parcels meant a lot to people during lockdowns and was the few links to the outside world and we relied more than ever on the network of key workers to keep us going. 

What motivates a NHS Nurse to do a twelve hour shift? Often without breaks and little recognition? It’s a selfless drive, discipline and genuine care for the wider community which keeps NHS Nurses serving and without them in our hour of need we would be truly lost without these pillars of the community."

Happy International Mountain Day! 🤗💥

@unitednations has declared this day to create awareness the importance of mountains to our lives. The theme of this year's #IMD is sustainable mountain tourism. According to stats, mountain tourism attracts around 15-20% of global tourism. Which is HUGE. Of course Covid-19 affected that number, but still we have to do everything in our power to protect our beautiful mountains. It won't be a surprise for you, but they are under threat from climate change. The glaciers are melting mindblowingly fast and that affects freshwater supplies for millions of people. Not to speak of the lives of mountain communities, these treasures host the half of the world's biodiversity hotspots.
So while admiring them, we shouldn't forget to protect them. 

Stay adventurous 👀 Stay healthy 💪 Stay green🍃

Just take a look at his record:

❌ Abbott abandoned Texas when the electrical grid failed, leaving millions without power and killing over 700 Texans during February's deadly winter storm.
❌ Abbott ignored science and public health advice, enacting policies to ban mask and vaccine requirements.
❌ Abbott failed to protect vulnerable Texans from Covid-19 leading to our state having the most children hospitalized with Covid once again.
❌ Abbott signed a bill into law that allows anyone to carry a loaded gun in public with no background check or training.
❌ Abbott signed into law the most extreme anti-choice, anti-women's health care bill in the country, which bans most abortions after six weeks.
❌ Abbott led the effort to restrict voting rights in Texas signing one of the most extreme voter suppression bills in the country into law.

The COVID pandemic appeared as a threat to human life, both in the vital sense (a risk to biological life) and in the social sense (a risk to social life: disruption from the suspension of activities, lack of public transport, closure of schools, etc.). It has revealed radical vulnerabilities: of institutions, the species, and the planet; of fragile populations, workers “on the front line,” and each individual. The importance of caring for others and for those who care for “us” has become obvious, while the broader ignorance of society as to what sustains it has finally become evident. The very grammar of care has imposed itself upon all of us, because our vulnerabilities are never so visible as when the “normal” form of life has been disrupted. The pandemic, in its destruction of the space of ordinary life and of “weak links” – places where the daily and anonymous interactions occurred – has also undermined the democratic public space. This talk considers how public life and human interactions can recover. Alexandre Gefen and Sandra Laugier will explore how arts and literature contribute to the expectation of reparation and social transformation, the (re)creation of relationships, the formation of social resilience and other narratives, and the development of an ethic of care.

Alexandre Gefen is a Research Professor (Directeur de recherche) at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS – Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), and Deputy Scientific Director of the Institute of Human and Social Sciences of the CNRS. His research focuses on literary theory and contemporary French literature and culture. As founder of the website Fabula.org, he has developed parallel research interests in the development of Digital Humanities. His recent books include: Vies imaginaires de la littérature française (2014); Réparer le monde: La littérature française face au XXIe siècle (2017), which will appear in English in 2022; and L’idée de littérature. De l’art pour l’art aux écritures d’intervention (2021).

Sandra Laugier is Professor of Philosophy at Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne (Paris, France), a Senior Fellow of the Institut Universitaire de France, and the Principal Investigator of the European Research Council (ERC) project DEMOSERIES. She has published extensively on ordinary language philosophy (Wittgenstein, Austin, Cavell), moral and political philosophy, gender studies and the ethics of care, and popular culture (film and TV series). She has translated most of Stanley Cavell’s work and is among the editors of his Nachlass. Her recent publications include: Why We Need Ordinary Language Philosophy (2013); Politics of the Ordinary. Care, Ethics, and Forms of Life (2020); and, edited with Greg Chase and Juliet Floyd, Cavell’s Must We Mean What We Say? at Fifty (2022).

❌ Dr. Oz is a Republican multi-millionaire who is 100% ready to self-fund this race with unlimited cash – starting with a reported multi-million dollar ad buy.

❌ He’s a longtime resident of New Jersey — NOT of Pennsylvania.

❌ He’s one of Donald Trump’s favorite doctors and a Trump administration appointee.

❌ He loves to push deadly disinformation about COVID-19 + and highlight vaccine deniers on his TV show.

That’s why it’s critical that we raise as much money as possible right now to defeat Dr. Oz and fight back.

I believe that our biggest domestic problem (by far) is out-of-control national debt.   Our biggest international problem is the rise of China, now our greatest autocratic rival. Here is how I evaluate the Biden Presidency after a year in office: 1) his plunging poll ratings his inability to deal effectively with either Covid or increasing inflation, (2) the federal reserve is prepared to address inflation by raising interest rates and reducing bond holdings.  This could easily lead to stagflation (inflation plus recession) which would further hurt Biden, 3) a red wave is likely in November which will lead to GOP control of the House and likely also the Senate, 4) Biden will still be president for two more years and we should all want him to succeed in foreign policy by reining in our autocratic rivals.

TWBC 2020/21 accounts, audited by September (achieved by only 9% of Councils) received a clean audit (the 12th consecutive year). The external auditor’s ‘Value for Money’ statement found that, despite the uncertainty and challenges posed by Covid, the Council has maintained a good financial position and that the Council's 'business as usual’, governance and adapted structures has demonstrated clear understanding of its role in securing economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.

During Covid, the Council successfully worked in partnerships with other authorities and contractors to deal with many related issues.  We continue to strive to provide the best services, economically and environmentally. Our contractual process is rigorous and highly controlled (by government). 

As a Council we get things done – consistently and sustainably, finding new income, reducing costs, while reducing CO2 emissions.

With the spread of the omicron variant, we asked our Chief Medical Officer to share the top 3 things South Carolinians need to know right now about the pandemic:

1. The best way to prevent the spread and protect yourself from COVID-19 is with a vaccine and booster shots. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control recommend everyone 5 years and older receive a primary series of the vaccine. The vaccines are working very well to protect against severe illness, hospitalization and death.

2. Recently the CDC recommended booster shots for children over 12 years old five months after the completion of the primary series of the vaccine.

3. South Carolinians should continue to wear face masks to prevent the spread of the omicron variant.

Find where to get a vaccine or booster shot: https://vaxlocator.dhec.sc.gov/.

Our intervention at the Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency (TIMMA) Committee meeting Nov. 9 yielded some significant results. Apologies for the length, but there is much to report.

For starters we objected to the narrow definition of what businesses qualify for toll subsidies. Under food services and distribution only the two island restaurants and the two grocery stores qualified. Many non-profit organizations on the island didn’t qualify because subsidies were available only to employees and many of these groups are staffed by volunteers, or depend on either members or clients that come to the island regularly to sustain themselves. Wineries and distilleries don’t qualify because they don’t serve food. 

We pointed out that island businesses did not have an opportunity to have input into these rules even though we asked staff for months to define the parameters of which food service businesses and nonprofits would qualify for subsidies. Although TIMMA staff acknowledged they were unaware of the different staffing models used on the island and that this information required further thought and discussion, they were unable to give us the details, saying they would get back to us with them. But the proposal went before the TIMMA Committee a few days later for a vote without our getting the information we had been promised.

In the Committee discussion that followed, Supervisor Matt Haney, chair of the committee and the district supervisor for Treasure Island, said he didn’t understand how long-term businesses could be left out of the subsidies and questioned the criteria for inclusion in the program. Staff informed Haney that the decision was based on Treasure Island Development Agency (TIDA) guidance - that only resident-serving businesses qualified. Haney said every time he’d been to the island’s wineries and distilleries he saw residents there.

“I’m not sure I support that approach,” he said, indicating that the policy needed to be revisited.

That may give our business members another chance to qualify for the subsidies. 

Transit Affordability?

Staff also presented new affordability proposals to the committee. New 50 percent discounts will be instituted for all future moderate and low income “travelers” to the island. That means all future residents and employees of island businesses, as well as visitors and customers whose income falls into those categories, will qualify. This new policy includes complete exemptions for those who qualify as “very low income.” 

One will have to apply for the income-based discounts through a yet-to-be developed FastTrak program. Proof of having qualified for below market rate housing, the PUC Care program or Muni Life Line will automatically qualify you for the discounts. Otherwise you will have to prove your income status. You will have to verify your income every two years to continue the discount. 

In addition staff proposed instituting TI transit passes ($150/month and “affordability” passes for $75/month) that will be good for unlimited use on tolls and ferries. 

Note that all the affordability exceptions and programs have been responses to three years of the TIOC constantly hammering that the toll is making the island unaffordable for the low and moderate residents the development was intended to serve, and also threatened the survival of the businesses on TI. Perhaps most important have been the unanimous calls for “No toll!” coming from residents and businesses. Our successes include the resident exemption, the subsidies for non-profits and food businesses, and discounts on the tolls and ferries.

Ferries

Staff announced that a ferry will begin running to San Francisco starting this January. The incentive for this new plan did not come about out of some concern for the current residents, but because the developers have started selling the “market rate” (read: “luxury”) condos on Yerba Buena Island and the ferries are part of the sales enticements. The developers will subsidize the cost of the ferries (leaving a $5 fare each way to ride) until the development’s ferry system is up and running in 2024. The developer ferry will run every 30 minutes, and every 15 minutes during peak times.

The money the developers will spend on their ferry over the next two years (before the project’s ferry service begins in 2024) will be in addition to the funds they are committed by the Development Agreement to spend on transit infrastructure.

Board Sailors, the Law and the Toll

Several members of the San Francisco Board Sailing Association spoke at the meeting. The SFBSA advocates for Windsurfers and Kiteboarders (Boardsailors) to have unrestricted access to San Francisco Bay, to create and improve boardsailing launch sites and facilities, and to promote and enhance boardsailing safety. SFBSA members pointed out that the toll obstructed the public’s access to public waterways for recreation. Several state laws, case law, the development’s Final EIR, the agreement between the City and County of San Francisco and the State Lands Commission, and even the legislation (AB981) granting the right to charge a toll on Treasure Island all guarantee that recreational public access right.

When Supervisor Haney asked staff how the city should deal with the public access issue, staff responded that the board sailors could simply pay the new low-income version of the toll. 

But nothing in the laws or agreements suggest that public access is dependent on payment of any fees. In fact, they explicitly are meant to encourage, not discourage, access and use of these public lands, SFBSA members pointed out. On Monday, Nov. 15 the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), the state agency tasked with and empowered to regulate development along the bay’s shoreline, including Treasure Island’s, sent TIMMA a letter saying its plan to charge a toll for non-resident visitors to TI appears to violate the agreement the city made with BCDC and the permit that authorized the construction. That discrepancy could require a review, the BCDC said. This issue may come up at the Wednesday, Nov. 17 community outreach meeting. (Meeting details below.)

All this begs the question: Why hasn’t the TIMMA planning staff or the City Attorney’s office ever addressed this glaring legal liability? 

And how will the FasTrak tolling transponders distinguish which cars carry the hundreds of water and other recreational visitors to the island? 

Another related question: How will that toll system deal with HOV vehicles that the toll’s enabling legislation, AB981, requires have free access to Treasure Island? 

Moreover, how could this project be so far along (and behind schedule) without someone in the City’s legal department having researched and read the laws and policies governing the development?

Union Crews

Since the documents provided for the hearing made no mention of it, we asked if the plans for the ferry included using union crews. Not only is it the right thing to do to provide jobs with good wages, health and retirement benefits, the Inlandboatmen’s Union ferry workers at ports all throughout the US and Canadian Pacific Coast ports are trained and licensed Able-Bodied Seamen, experts on safety on the water. We were reassured they would have the ferry jobs.

TI transportation program costs

TIOC member Jim Mirowski thanked the TIMMA staff for finally providing some of the financial numbers we have been requesting for some two years. But in the presented high-level budget for the first five years of the tolls and transportation costs there was little in supporting assumptions, no details on traffic patterns, toll revenues were not explained, and it contained little in the way of cost details on many of the important aspects of the program. 

Mirowski noted that from their own numbers:

Total program costs for first five years: $125M
Shortfalls even with Developer subsidies: $25M
Total Cost for the Ferry/Shuttle/On-call Bus to Oakland: $34M.

Mirowski asked why TIMMA is spending $125M for the toll program when the incremental total transportation only cost $34M for the first five years? Even with some Federal funding, that leaves a shortfall that would require the developer to burn through the remainder of its subsidy fund to cover it. He suggested pushing back the implementation of the toll until 2028 and subsidize the ferry and bus until 2028. In short it would be less cost, and could encourage ferry use.

During Public Comment, Mirowski encouraged the Board of Supervisors and TIDA board members to watch the videos of the outreach meetings to witness the level of frustration as fundamental questions the community has been asking for a long time are either ignored or never answered. Issues ranged from a lack of an economic impact study, updated post-Covid traffic forecasts, and which businesses qualify for the proposed subsidies to questions regarding the surveys of residents. Many of the issues may be larger than the specifics of transportation planning, but without the background, the community cannot reasonably comment on the proposed toll. 

Most of the project’s assumptions were done in 2011 and 2014 and the world has changed, he said. We need to stop looking at the project through the soda straw of transportation planning, and understand what the economic impact of the toll will be on Treasure Island businesses and the community."

𝑨𝒏 𝑶𝒓𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 allowing the development of the Trolley Barn Parcel on Cranston Street passed allowing the land to be zoned from heavy commercial to retail.  On that site there will be an Auto Zone warehouse and an Auto Zone retail store, a gas station, a bank, and a fast-food restaurant.  There was a lot of discussion on the ordinance.  Opposition to the ordinance was largely due to the fact that there was no effort to include any type of affordable housing on the site.  This did raise awareness that there is definitely a need for more affordable housing in Cranston.  An issue that the Council agrees on.

𝑨 𝑹𝒆𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 allowing the City and the Council to conduct a poll seeking input from the residents of Cranston on how to spend the Federal ARPA Funds (Covid Money).  The resolution will seek the best possible way to make sure the poll has a fair means of distribution and that the demographics are properly weighted.

𝑨𝒍𝒍 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒊𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒆 business that was passed last week at Claims, Public Works, and Ordinance Committee were passed by the Full Council except the traffic ordinance for Tabor Street which is awaiting a traffic study. That Ordinance was continued.

𝑨𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒔 were Abbey Rondeau to the Arts Commission, John Skorupski as Tree Warden, and Jason Case to the Affordable Housing Commission.

𝑨𝑹𝑷𝑨 𝑭𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒔 Public Workshops will be held on Thursday January 27th and Thursday February 10th.  The public is invited.  For the time being the meetings will be virtual.  You can find the link on the City Calendar: https://www.cranstonri.gov/calendar/
 You will be allowed to testify on how the ARPA funds should be spent.  

𝑪𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒍 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 included an update on the Friendly Playground, an update from the administration on the progress of the Diversity Commission, and an update on a Proposed Partnership with the Providence Warwick Convention Bureau on hosting events such as a Restaurant week.

For one, no domestic violence. I envisioned angry, violent abusers finding their way into my office, and I was definitely not going to put myself in those kinds of unsafe circumstances.

What I soon found out, however, is that the new client who comes to therapy with symptoms of depression, or anxiety, or unspecified life stressors may only later disclose violence within a relationship. Or, more commonly, a feeling that something in that relationship ""just doesn't feel right.""

And while abusers, sadly, have at times attacked therapists, they are more likely to enter the therapist's office as the concerned, involved, overly attentive spouse or partner-at least at first.

And so, I came to work with people dealing with domestic violence. Because ready or not, they found me. And because there was a need.

I also wasn't going to work too much with trauma. I thought I was much better suited to help people with symptoms of depression, or anxiety, or family issues.

Until people walked into my office with those types of complaints, and proceeded to disclose all of their trauma. Or, more commonly, to describe the overwhelming anxiety that started after a certain experience that they may not have even processed as traumatic. I soon found myself searching for trauma-focused continuing education and certifications, as I laughed at my own naivete. 

If only trauma could be checked off in a neat little box on an intake form.

Similarly, I wasn't looking to focus too much on grief. I actually enjoyed doing grief work with people, but I didn't envision a large percentage of my working hours being focused on something that could also be emotionally draining.

But again, people who came in with other issues soon shared the grief they were feeling over lost loved ones, and lost relationships, and lost opportunities.

I wondered how I ever thought I could limit how much I focused on grief.

And then came Covid, which brought with it more grief, and more trauma, and yes, also more domestic violence (as well as addiction and social isolation). And those things are currently the focus of most of my work. Not because I sought to be a trauma therapist or a grief therapist or someone who specializes in domestic violence, but because as therapists, we are trained to meet people where they are. 

And right now, this is where people are.

Please don't be afraid to reach out if you or a loved one is struggling. We will meet you where you are, or find someone who can."

Do you know an individual, team or community group that deserves special recognition? Please nominate them by clicking here: https://mattwestern.org/mp-awards/  

After another challenging year, it seems only right we celebrate those who have worked hardest for the Warwick and Leamington community. 

It could be a public services team such as the staff at the Frailty Unit at Warwick Hospital who won last year’s award for battling Covid and saving lives during the pandemic. 

It could be an inspiring individual whose efforts have helped those in need. 

Or it could be a business or community group which you feel deserves credit - like last year’s winners LWS Night Shelter or the New Life Church in Warwick which supplied food parcels to children without free school meals.

Unfortunately, I haven’t received as many nominations as I did last year.

I am hoping that over the next few days people find the time to fill out the short form on my website and nominate those who deserve our gratitude. 

There are so many people who go the extra mile for our community and last year’s event – viewed by more than 3,500 people – was a truly uplifting way to reward them.

This means getting vaccinated. Getting your booster. Wearing face masks when out and about. And testing regularly with lateral flows, and isolating and getting a PCR when you start to experience symptoms.

With schools going back, secondary pupils will be asked to wear masks in classrooms as well as around the school now. More 12-15 year olds must also come forward for their dose of the vaccine, and 16 and 17 year olds can book in their second. 

All of this will help us to start to bring cases down, ease pressure on the NHS and ultimately to save lives."

You’re invited to a live, statewide organizing and strategy call with Maine Healthcare Action board members and activists Betsy Sweet and Lisa Savage!

What: LIVE! Organizing/Strategy call for Universal Healthcare ballot measure
When: Wednesday, December 8, 2021, 7 p.m.
Where: Zoom

We’re continuing our push to collect signatures to put this important issue on the ballot next November, and we need all Mainers who can to join us in accomplishing this goal.

You know the situation. Insurance companies have made billions in profits during the Covid-19 pandemic while Mainers pay hefty monthly premiums for insufficient coverage. We plan to change this by putting this Universal Healthcare resolve on the ballot. 

Betsy and Lisa will be joined by current Maine Healthcare Action volunteers, Mainers just like you who have been out collecting signatures from friends and neighbors because they believe no Mainer should go without the healthcare they need due to cost. You’ll learn about the Universal Healthcare resolve and how you can get involved.

Will you join us? https://mainehealthcareaction.nationbuilder.com/statewide_strategy_call"

A number of residents have raised a desire to see the 330A route extended beyond Mount Charles to include The Rowans. 

It’s a relatively short distance that we believe could be added without a reduction in service elsewhere. 

Alliance has written to Translink, who disappointingly have declined our request at this stage. 

However, they have committed to consider developing this service in the future as they seek to enhance frequencies and improve the route network post-Covid.

It’s a telling observation that not one of Boris Johnson’s ministers has been willing to publicly defend – or even describe – the so-called Government’s position on the Christmas Party in No 10 last year. It is after all indefensible. 
This laughing in the face of the British public exposes the real character of Boris Johnson’s vanity Government. The claim from the Prime Minister and his ministers has unsurprisingly been that it is their top priority to make certain lives are saved. But this latest revelation goes to show that it’s easy to make such a claim not so easy to stick to their own rules. It takes a moral compass and talent to make good on a promise.
So let me remind you what we were told around the time this infamous gathering was obviously taking place. Johnson was announcing that the planned relaxation of restrictions for up to three households to form a ‘Christmas bubble’ was being reduced from five days to Christmas Day only.
This meant that friends and families could only meet on Christmas Day, rather than from the period in December as had been previously announced.
Meanwhile, the NHS was flat out while members of Downing Street’s elite were apparently taking part in illegal revelry. Indeed, on that Friday in December, there was desperation in many hospital corridors. Doctors and nurses were in the middle of a repeat of Covid’s first wave earlier in the year. The infection rates per 100,000 people in Rochdale had increased by more than 216 (48%) in the seven days leading up to 14 December.
Pandemic casualties were threatening to overwhelm available wards and overcrowded ICUs. Patients were struggling as NHS staff scrambled to find iPads and other equipment so they could be connected to their families, who after all were not allowed to visit in person. Throughout the country, people were dying because ventilators had to be rationed. Doctors and nurses described it as being like applying field medicine of a most brutal kind.
On 18 December, we are now being told that members of this Tory government and its advisers were nibbling cheese and quaffing champagne, while NHS staffs were tackling the symptoms of those people too weak to have any chance of surviving Covid. These included older people and those who needed to be immunosuppressed because of their underlying health conditions.  
It was not as if at the end of last year this was a new phenomenon. We had witnessed this horror earlier in the year too. But instead of listening to his scientific advisers, who had warned of the importance of winter restrictions, Johnson hadn’t been able to resist the cheap populism of being seen as the one who “saved Christmas”. 
In fact, on 18 December, the Covid death toll had reached 68,442. Just two months later on 19 February, it reached 121,867. Johnson’s vanity government effectively cost the country more than 50,000 deaths from Covid alone in that period.
It’s not good enough and even today they are floundering about playing games with our lives.

During the last month I’ve attended various online meetings including Full Council on the 3rd November and Social Services Scrutiny Committee on 23rd November. Throughout the month I’ve also had discussions online and in meetings with officers on a variety of issues, including street lighting, street cleansing, parking and road adoption relating to the Ward.

There was a good turnout attendance at Treharris Ward PACT Meeting on the 15th November at The Community Centre. Treharris Neighbourhood Police Team gave their monthly update and reported 75 calls, an increase from last month. There were no calls regarding anti-social behaviour on Halloween and Bonfire Night. It was noted there had been a few posts on Social Media about “egging’s” in the days afterwards, but no record of them being reported to the Police. There have been no burglaries, in the last month, but a number of antisocial behaviour incidents and criminal damage. Priorities for the month are again parking issues in the Treharris Ward and antisocial behaviour on The Square. The next meeting is on Monday 13th December at Treharris Community Centre, please note the earlier start time of 5. 30pm.Remember if you wish to report a non-urgent crime or incident phone 101 or do it online, in an emergency always phone 999

I held a street surgeries at The Square on the 4th and 19th November, Cllrs Ernie Galsworthy, Ian Thomas and I held Cuppa with your Councillors at Treharris Rugby Club on the 13th November and the Quakers Yard Inn on the 27th November. The next one and last before Christmas is at The Western, Edwardsville on the 11th December at 11.30 am

It was good to see an excellent turnout for Remembrance Sunday 14th November and to be joined by Professor Peter Vaughan the Lord Lieutenant of Mid Glamorgan. As part of the Remembrance Service at St Matthias Church there was a Dedication of the Book of Remembrance to those from the Treharris area who lost their lives in WW2, this had been postponed from the VE Commemoration in May 2020 due to Covid. After the Service there was the usual parade to the Act of Remembrance at the Memorial Clock at Treharris Library. Thanks to Fr Gareth was conducting the services, Alan Jones for attending with his standard, David Wilton for painting the railings and gate at the Library, Andrew and Ross Coombs for donating artificial turf, Alan Yoxall for assisting me fit the large poppies around the centre of Treharris, Jayne Edwards and Natasha Staples for serving light refreshments at Treharris Community Centre, Howard Bull for playing. But big thanks to the current service personnel, veterans and residents who attended to show their respects to those who had fallen over the years.

I was pleased to volunteer collecting for Royal British Legion at Tesco, Merthyr Tydfil. The #PoppyAppeal does amazing work to support our Armed Forces community. Thank you to everyone who stopped by to support.

Taff Bargoed Food Bank this month there’s been a good response again from residents dropping off food donations to me in October, thanks to everyone it’s really appreciated. If you wish you can drop any items to me at 2 The Hollies Quakers Yard CF46 5PJ or phone 07968797776 and I’ll deliver them to Fr Gareth. There’s a black box alongside my garage to place items in if I’m not at home. If you need assistance contact me as I can make referrals in complete confidence.

I chaired the monthly meeting of the Quakers Yard Community Association Committee Meeting on the 4th November. On Thursday 25th November I attended a meeting of Edwardsville Primary School Governors and on the 26th November a meeting of the trustees Nursery Rhymes Playgroup trustees.

On the 13th November myself and Cllrs Ernie Galsworthy and Ian Thomas presented a cheque from the Ffos y Fran Small Grant Fund to Treharris Phoenix RFC, towards sports development at the Club. We have tried to make as many grants as possible available to various voluntary clubs and organisation to assist them in delivering well-being projects in the Treharris Ward.

On the 18th November I met with Noah Shepherd who works at Treharris Boys and Girls Club where he outlined his project for a Treharris Heritage Room at the Club. Watch out for future details.

I was pleased to attend the Scott Abbruzzese Sporting Scholarship presentation on the 20th November. The Scholarship provides financial support and recognition to young people and their sporting endeavours in the CF46 postcode. It good to see Dawn Bowden MS the Treharris Phoenix Rugby Football Club President help present the awards along with Scott's parents and family. I’m told the standard of entries was simply awe inspiring. After a lot of deliberation, the Judges awarded the following awards to three brilliant sporting stars of the future.
Commendation Award- Ffion Holly Lloyd- Swimming, Ffion was presented with her award and a cheque for £300
Scott Abbruzzese Scholarship Award- Ruby Day- Football, Ruby was presented with her award and a cheque for £500

As you will recall the Council only provide Christmas lights at Treharris Square (these are being fitted this week), for the last few years I’ve been able to secure funding for a small number of frames in Quakers Yard and Edwardsville. These have been paid for by organisation and local businesses.

Casework -here’s a flavour of some of the casework issues this month, I’ve also dealt with several individual personal issues which are confidential, Please bear with me currently as things are taking longer than usual as some Council staff are still working remotely

You will recall I reported last month that work had been started by Welsh Water to replace the stones at the crossing at Treharris Square, they removed them last year when dealing with emergency work. I’ve now been told that this will be completed in half term in February as it will require a road closure. It is good to see work has been carried out on the Pink Path, particularly the steps at Evan Street which were dangerous

A site meeting was held 26th November between the Council and Merthyr Valleys Homes, (I also attended) regarding the defective lighting on the path from Bargoed Terrace to Oaklands Terrace (Bargoed Close), this is currently being looked at to determine who is responsible i.e., the Council or Merthyr Valleys Homes. The light in the centre of the Pentwyn Roundabout has now been repaired after a considerable time of chasing this. I received reports that the lights at Treharris Bus Station were not working after reporting them they are now fixed. There is an ongoing problem with lights being out at lights Fiddlers Elbow, I’ve discussed this with officers, and they are working on the issue. 

There has been fly-tipping again in the rear lane at Webster Street this was reported and should now have been dealt with. 

There have been various issues regarding Recycling and Refuse Collections reported to me by residents which I’ve reported. I’ve also assisted a number of residents to order new recycling receptacles.

The Household Waste & Recycling Centre are now open on Winter hours. These are 9am until 4.30pm with last admittance 4.20pm.

The garden waste collection service will cease on Friday 3rd December 2021, so if this Thursday is your week for collection, this will be your last. Garden Waste Collection will re-commence in April 2022.Garden waste can still be taken to the HWRCs at Dowlais and Aberfan year-round.

I’ve received queries as to the closing times for vehicles at Beechgrove Cemetery, the Council are operating Winter hours and the vehicle gates will be locked at approximately 6pm. 

I’ve reported blocked drains at Fox Street and Williams Terrace, which should now have been cleaned. I’ve continued to press the Council to ensure the open drain at Pentwyn Deintyr is regularly cleared of debris

During the month I’ve contacted the Council in relation to a number of areas that need tree cutting at Windsor Place, rear of Wingfield Terrace tree, rear Beacon Court and Cwm Cothi Road some of these have been dealt with where the COUNCIL is responsible, in other cases the landowners have been written to. I reported a fallen tree on the Taff Trail as a result of Storm Arwen which should now have been dealt with.

I have also requested the Council to clear up fallen leaves zig zag path, Fiddlers to QYD footpath leaves Pantanas and Wingfield, Mill Road. I am also pleased to see that the footpath at top part of Bargoed Terrace has cleared of moss.

In the summer I was requested to carry out a walkabout of Firtree Drive with residents, who pointed out to me various issues that needed attention by the Council. I’m pleased to see that the safety barrier has been replaced, sections of the footpath resurfaced, step edges painted, and bollards installed at requested locations. There are two issues outstanding the brickwork in the top path and a handrail, the first should be carried out soon and the handrail depending on this year’s finances, but it is on the list to do.

The three Ward Councillors have received numerous requests for dog fouling bins specifically on the Quakers Yard to Edwardsville section of the Taff Trail, rear of Treharris Library, Forest Grove and Millbrook, funding has been secured and they are on order. In addition, I’ve been continuing to press Hafod Housing to replace the dog fouling bin at Firtree Drive and also provide an additional one there.

If you have an urgent matter please call me on 07968 797776 or email gareth.richards1@merthyr.gov.uk  or Cllr Ernie Galsworthy on 01443 412961 or email ernie.galsworthy@merthyr.gov.uk or Cllr Ian Thomas on 01443 410861 or email  ian.thomas@merthyr.gov.uk

Finally, myself, Ernie and Ian would like to wish all residents of Edwardsville, Quakers Yard and Treharris a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year - Nadolig Llawen a Blwyddyn Newydd Dda

Fortunately, the economy has strong momentum in terms of both real and nominal growth heading into any potential Omicron slowdown.

As for the Fed, in an appearance before Congress, Jay Powell acknowledged inflation has been higher and more persistent than expected (effectively retiring the term “transitory”) and raised concern that Omicron has the potential to exacerbate inflationary pressures further. As such, he signaled that the Fed would likely turn its attention away from supporting the economy towards fighting inflation, beginning with an accelerated tapering of its bond-buying program beginning this month.  This pivot should not be viewed as risk-friendly for the markets, particularly for the highly valued speculative stocks that previously benefited from low volatility and extraordinary liquidity. 

There is a clear disconnect at present between strong economic growth, high rates of inflation, and the Federal Funds rate at 0%.  The Fed’s emergency liquidity measures should have ended long ago and will now be more difficult and painful to correct. 

We believe there are a number of favorable growth drivers that should help us rebound from any Omicron slowdown including:  global reopening, a housing rebound, an auto rebound, and inventory replenishment.  The US consumer remains in great shape (excess savings and record high net worth) and in position to power the economy ahead as confidence recovers. 

We continue to actively monitor risks such as margin pressures caused by rising input costs, an inflationary wage-price spiral that forces the Fed to act sooner and more forcefully than expected, new “Big Tech” regulatory or legislative constraints, geopolitical conflicts (Russia/Ukraine; China/Taiwan), and additional Covid disruptions that could once again impede the recovery.

She argued this was the earliest proof that someone had taken the time to care for someone else who’d been injured .

But this bone had healed, which meant that the person was protected while vulnerable and fed and cared for. That, for her, was the start of civilisation. The thing that separates us from animals.

So, you have have to ask the question: if we don’t care for others; if we don’t feed them; if we don’t take them in and give them shelter what does that say about us as humans?

When we trap migrants at borders, force them to find illegal help to cross seas, cut aid, close borders, slash benefits or keep all the covid vaccines for ourselves…what does that say about modern civilisation?"

Join us Wednesday 19 January 7:00pm

In 2010, after a decade of investment, our NHS was delivering its best-ever performance: After more than a decade of austerity – despite heroic efforts by staff to keep services afloat – it has sunk to its worst-ever. The problems were growing before the pandemic, but have been deepened by the sudden and continued loss of capacity and continued high level of Covid infections.

But it doesn’t have to be this way, with the political will we can fully fund our NHS, end interference from the private sector, pay staff properly and once again secure an NHS able to keep us all safe.

We'll be joined by speakers from Keep Our NHS Public, Health Campaigns Together, People’s Assembly Against Austerity, Unite the Union, GMB, We Own It, NHS Support Federation, NHS Workers Say No, NHS Staff Voices, Doctors in Unite, Doctors for the NHS, personalities, politicians and more, which we'll announce in the new year.

As we sip warm drinks, relish chocolate and share cosy dinners with friends and family, let us not forget those in need. 

Global hunger is rising again. According to the United Nations, 811 million people still go hungry. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and political crisis, the number of undernourished people grew by as many as 161 million in the last two years. 
 
 
Muntada Aid’s Feed the Forgotten Programme 

Our Feed the Forgotten Programme is providing food to families living in conflict zones, economically poor, and people living in areas affected by climate change. 
 Our programme operates in 23 countries with a permanent project in Yemen; one of the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation. 

 Since June 2020, we have distributed over 1.1 million meals to families living at Taiz Refugee camp outside Aden, Yemen. 
 
This holiday season, share the joy of giving.

Kyle P. Dukes Files to Seek Re-election as Sheriff of Kosciusko County

I am excited to announce that today I submitted paperwork to formally file my candidacy for re-election as Sheriff of Kosciusko County.  I am extremely proud of the direction we have taken the Kosciusko County Sheriff’s Office over the last three years.  It would be my privilege to continue this important work of putting Community First and emphasizing transparency, accountability, and professionalism as I serve Kosciusko County.

I graduated from East Noble High School in 1995, following which I earned an associate’s degree in Supervision from Ivy Tech State College and a bachelor’s degree in Business Management from Tri-State University. I started my law enforcement career as a Reserve Deputy for the Noble County Sheriff’s Office in 1998.  In December of 2000, I graduated from the Indiana State Police Recruit School and went on to serve Kosciusko and Elkhart Counties as a trooper for 18 years.  On January 1, 2019, I took office as Sheriff of Kosciusko County.  

During my first term as Sheriff, many accomplishments have been achieved: 

• One of my top priorities as Sheriff was to bring all law enforcement back together in a working relationship.  I am proud to say that today, the Sheriff’s Office has a great relationship with all police agencies in Kosciusko County.  We have continued our routine police chief meetings that I implemented during my campaign.  These meetings are instrumental in keeping all agencies on the same page and focused on one common goal for bettering our county.

• With our community’s involvement, we currently have the number one Jail Chemical Addiction Program (JCAP) in the state of Indiana.  Our program has a 59% success rate of graduates staying clean and sober upon reentry into the community.  We have close to 30 local businesses and organizations who volunteer their time to come into our jail to mentor and teach. Currently, there is a Sheriff’s Office in the state of Tennessee that has started their own JCAP program because of the successful program we’ve built here in Kosciusko County.

• Another campaign promise I fulfilled is creating a multi-agency drug task force.  Known as NET 43, this elite group consists of officers from the Sheriff’s Office, Warsaw Police Department, Winona Lake Police Department, Indiana State Police, and the Nappanee Police Department. This team has taken numerous drug dealers off the streets in Kosciusko County and has confiscated pounds of heroin and meth.

• I created a full-time training sergeant and made it a priority to provide specialized training not only to the deputy sheriffs, but also to the dispatchers, jail officers, reserve deputies, boat patrol officers, kitchen staff, front office staff, and work release guards.  Many of these training sessions have also been opened up to all police agencies in the county.  In 2020, the Sheriff’s Office logged over 5000 training hours.  In 2021, the Sheriff’s Office completed more than 7200 hours of training.

• I created a full-time public information officer to offer transparency to the public who entrusts their safety to our team of professionals.  Our public information officer has been instrumental in running the Sheriff’s Office Facebook and Twitter pages, which allows law enforcement to work hand-in-hand with the public.  Conducting safety talks within our local school systems as well as safety presentations to our elderly have also been important community initiatives.

• I significantly reduced the jail population by working closely with Community Corrections, Work Release, and Probation.  I inherited a jail with a population of 334 inmates when I took office.  The legal capacity of our jail is 294 people.  Currently, we have 248 inmates incarcerated at the Kosciusko County Jail.  Because of our leadership and command staff in the jail, we have had no significant Covid outbreaks within the jail.  In 2021, jail officers logged a combined 2,158.5 hours of training. I am extremely proud of the jail staff who work tirelessly to ensure the well-being and safety of all inmates. 

The Sheriff’s Office has worked extremely hard to be a positive force in our community.  I am proud of the accomplishments we have achieved over the last several years and am eager to continue the programs I have implemented as Sheriff as we remain focused on putting Community First.

In their time as state representatives, Maria and Jack have served Framingham with enthusiasm and savvy, identifying issues of importance to our city and the state as a whole, and collaborating to address those issues. Working in partnership with Senate President Spilka, Maria and Jack have also helped Framingham to be truly on the map in terms of state financial support.

Further, in the covid era, their leadership has been instrumental in addressing Framingham's unique challenges and ensuring that we are not forgotten among the largest communities in our state.

532,532,912314583011243.0,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,"Treasure Island Toll Updates From Thanks Jim Steve TI Wine Our intervention at the Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency TIMMA Committee meeting Nov yielded some significant results Apologies for the length but there is much to report For starters we objected to the narrow definition of what businesses qualify for toll subsidies Under food services and distribution only the two island restaurants and the two grocery stores qualified Many non profit organizations on the island didn t qualify because subsidies were available only to employees and many of these groups are staffed by volunteers or depend on either members or clients that come to the island regularly to sustain themselves Wineries and distilleries don t qualify because they don t serve food We pointed out that island businesses did not have an opportunity to have input into these rules even though we asked staff for months to define the parameters of which food service businesses and nonprofits would qualify for subsidies Although TIMMA staff acknowledged they were unaware of the different staffing models used on the island and that this information required further thought and discussion they were unable to give us the details saying they would get back to us with them But the proposal went before the TIMMA Committee a few days later for a vote without our getting the information we had been promised In the Committee discussion that followed Supervisor Matt Haney chair of the committee and the district supervisor for Treasure Island said he didn t understand how long term businesses could be left out of the subsidies and questioned the criteria for inclusion in the program Staff informed Haney that the decision was based on Treasure Island Development Agency TIDA guidance that only resident serving businesses qualified Haney said every time he d been to the island s wineries and distilleries he saw residents there I m not sure I support that approach he said indicating that the policy needed to be revisited That may give our business members another chance to qualify for the subsidies Transit Affordability Staff also presented new affordability proposals to the committee New percent discounts will be instituted for all future moderate and low income travelers to the island That means all future residents and employees of island businesses as well as visitors and customers whose income falls into those categories will qualify This new policy includes complete exemptions for those who qualify as very low income One will have to apply for the income based discounts through a yet to be developed FastTrak program Proof of having qualified for below market rate housing the PUC Care program or Muni Life Line will automatically qualify you for the discounts Otherwise you will have to prove your income status You will have to verify your income every two years to continue the discount In addition staff proposed instituting TI transit passes month and affordability passes for month that will be good for unlimited use on tolls and ferries Note that all the affordability exceptions and programs have been responses to three years of the TIOC constantly hammering that the toll is making the island unaffordable for the low and moderate residents the development was intended to serve and also threatened the survival of the businesses on TI Perhaps most important have been the unanimous calls for No toll coming from residents and businesses Our successes include the resident exemption the subsidies for non profits and food businesses and discounts on the tolls and ferries Ferries Staff announced that a ferry will begin running to San Francisco starting this January The incentive for this new plan did not come about out of some concern for the current residents but because the developers have started selling the market rate read luxury condos on Yerba Buena Island and the ferries are part of the sales enticements The developers will subsidize the cost of the ferries leaving a fare each way to ride until the development s ferry system is up and running in The developer ferry will run every minutes and every minutes during peak times The money the developers will spend on their ferry over the next two years before the project s ferry service begins in will be in addition to the funds they are committed by the Development Agreement to spend on transit infrastructure Board Sailors the Law and the Toll Several members of the San Francisco Board Sailing Association spoke at the meeting The SFBSA advocates for Windsurfers and Kiteboarders Boardsailors to have unrestricted access to San Francisco Bay to create and improve boardsailing launch sites and facilities and to promote and enhance boardsailing safety SFBSA members pointed out that the toll obstructed the public s access to public waterways for recreation Several state laws case law the development s Final EIR the agreement between the City and County of San Francisco and the State Lands Commission and even the legislation AB granting the right to charge a toll on Treasure Island all guarantee that recreational public access right When Supervisor Haney asked staff how the city should deal with the public access issue staff responded that the board sailors could simply pay the new low income version of the toll But nothing in the laws or agreements suggest that public access is dependent on payment of any fees In fact they explicitly are meant to encourage not discourage access and use of these public lands SFBSA members pointed out On Monday Nov the Bay Conservation and Development Commission BCDC the state agency tasked with and empowered to regulate development along the bay s shoreline including Treasure Island s sent TIMMA a letter saying its plan to charge a toll for non resident visitors to TI appears to violate the agreement the city made with BCDC and the permit that authorized the construction That discrepancy could require a review the BCDC said This issue may come up at the Wednesday Nov community outreach meeting Meeting details below All this begs the question Why hasn t the TIMMA planning staff or the City Attorney s office ever addressed this glaring legal liability And how will the FasTrak tolling transponders distinguish which cars carry the hundreds of water and other recreational visitors to the island Another related question How will that toll system deal with HOV vehicles that the toll s enabling legislation AB requires have free access to Treasure Island Moreover how could this project be so far along and behind schedule without someone in the City s legal department having researched and read the laws and policies governing the development Union Crews Since the documents provided for the hearing made no mention of it we asked if the plans for the ferry included using union crews Not only is it the right thing to do to provide jobs with good wages health and retirement benefits the Inlandboatmen s Union ferry workers at ports all throughout the US and Canadian Pacific Coast ports are trained and licensed Able Bodied Seamen experts on safety on the water We were reassured they would have the ferry jobs TI transportation program costs TIOC member Jim Mirowski thanked the TIMMA staff for finally providing some of the financial numbers we have been requesting for some two years But in the presented high level budget for the first five years of the tolls and transportation costs there was little in supporting assumptions no details on traffic patterns toll revenues were not explained and it contained little in the way of cost details on many of the important aspects of the program Mirowski noted that from their own numbers Total program costs for first five years M Shortfalls even with Developer subsidies M Total Cost for the Ferry Shuttle On call Bus to Oakland M Mirowski asked why TIMMA is spending M for the toll program when the incremental total transportation only cost M for the first five years Even with some Federal funding that leaves a shortfall that would require the developer to burn through the remainder of its subsidy fund to cover it He suggested pushing back the implementation of the toll until and subsidize the ferry and bus until In short it would be less cost and could encourage ferry use During Public Comment Mirowski encouraged the Board of Supervisors and TIDA board members to watch the videos of the outreach meetings to witness the level of frustration as fundamental questions the community has been asking for a long time are either ignored or never answered Issues ranged from a lack of an economic impact study updated post Covid traffic forecasts and which businesses qualify for the proposed subsidies to questions regarding the surveys of residents Many of the issues may be larger than the specifics of transportation planning but without the background the community cannot reasonably comment on the proposed toll Most of the project s assumptions were done in and and the world has changed he said We need to stop looking at the project through the soda straw of transportation planning and understand what the economic impact of the toll will be on Treasure Island businesses and the community

543,543,1048550000000000.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,"CHANGE IS IN THE WIND January Good Wednesday morning Welcome to RUPP S NOTES FBI SPECIAL AGENT HARTMANN SERIES weekly post I m the author Richard V Rupp writing from Burbank California Robocalls are driving me nuts I suspect it has something to do with the work from home thing Both in who is making the calls and the fact more people are at home to receive them Over the past couple of weeks I averaged six to eight a day Today s post is an example of what I did for a living many years ago Advise management based on my research on what changes may impact the business in the foreseeable future But instead of writing a report to senior insurance company management I will present what I foresee to you and use some of the material in my upcoming novel SKYWARD Significant factors that I believe will impact the new normal are Impact of the changing of the guard as Millennials and Gen Z s take over running things This is a shrinking world caused by overpopulation and decreased usable landmass due to climate change The darkening of the populations complexion caused by migration and changing birthrates A move toward socialist structure A move away from fossil fuels and Yes the long term impact caused by the COVID pandemic An example of what the pandemic has done is the consideration by Lloyd s of London to move from their flagship City of London headquarters I spend a lot of time in both the original Lloyds building and its replacement tower designed by British architect Richard Rogers Why the move Because the pandemic speeded up Lloyds move to automation and away from doing business on its underwriting floor A Lloyd s spokesperson said As we adapt to new structures and flexible ways of working we are continuing to carefully think about the future requirements for the spaces and services our marketplace needs Like many other organizations we are considering a range of options around our workspace strategy and the future leasing arrangements for Lloyd s Companies are reassessing their office space as the COVID pandemic showed working from home was viable Lloyd s is just one example of how businesses have been impacted and why office space is now being converted to apartments and condos Millennials and Z s don t live in the past and except for scientific advancements consider historical social information of little value Like my dad used to tell me Don t look in the rearview mirror unless you want to go that way Millennials and Z s are either looking ahead or are looking at a metaverse unreal or make believe world This is evident because they don t believe traditional higher education is of value In fact they think it may slow down their advancement in the world This fall has seen the sharpest enrolment decline among people and older into four year colleges according to Clearinghouse data They see their peers entering the working world through inventiveness tied to electronic devices Doug Shapiro executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center said in an interview Students are questioning the value of college They may be looking at friends who graduated last year or the year before who didn t go and they seem to be doing fine The above concept is also seen in reading habits change A December Gallup poll indicates that fewer people are reading books The average American adult read just over books in the smallest average number than any prior survey dating back to The number of big readers has dropped hard and that s what s weighing on the overall average Currently just report that they read more than books Gallup says down eight percentage points since and lower than every prior measure by at least four points That decline was particularly marked among college graduates and older readers I had to laugh at an article that indicated Men are finally catching up to women when it comes to book reading That s only because women are reading fewer books The Gallup editors conclude Reading appears to be in decline as a favorite way for Americans to spend their free time Millennials and Z s also tie religion to the past and have placed it on the chopping block A recent Pew Research Center report indicates that the number of Americans with no religious affiliation has nearly doubled over the past years from to Self identified Christians dropped from to during the same period Most Americans believe U S democracy is in danger According to a Brookings report one in five Americans has views that make them at least open to if not outright supportive of authoritarianism According to CNN of us are angry about the state of the nation and USA Today indicates that only of us think things are going well think civil war is likely and we are split about equal as to dividing the country into two parts Aogby Analytics ABC News says of us believe the economy is doing poorly And have been adversely affected by inflation Yet according to a Gallup survey of Americans say they are currently thriving the highest number in years The use by large corporations of bots A I and automation in general will significantly increase as the attitude of the workforce changes pushed by the pandemic A record number of U S workers have quit their jobs in the past few months More than million people voluntarily walked away from their positions in November up from million in October November s figure was the highest since the government started tracking the figure two decades ago Government regulations to curb the use of fossil fuels and infrastructure investments will increase the use of electric vehicles and drones The inefficiencies of wind and solar energy will renew the interest in nuclear power The United States and China will dramatically expand their military drones and bots technology The newly developed weapon systems will significantly change warfare The U S may test these new weapon systems in Ukraine with the U S providing advisors to Ukraine if Russian troops invade Finally all of the above convinces me that increased inflation will be with us for the next couple of years It was at in December The cost of food my steaks at Costco have gone up apparel and especially used cars are draining our wallets a lot faster The Federal Reserve is on high alert for how this could affect the economy Back to researching thinking and using the above info in my novel SKYWARD Please be kind to each other and stay safe Cheers Richard V Rupp Author Website www richardvrupp com Email rupprisk gmail com

“There is a perception in the community that we have spent a tremendous amount of money on homelessness and gotten very little in return, but that is just not true. 

Until very recently locally we spent almost nothing on homelessness, and we got is what we paid for. Happily we have started to see more infusions of resources from the federal government, but they’ve been all tied to COVID and they’re going to disappear when COVID leaves. What those monies have been used for are visible things like standing up the Sullivan Arena shelter, and that’s been a very helpful and vital endeavor, but it hasn’t given us new capacity, it hasn’t created a net number of new beds to address the homelessness problem that has grown over the years.”

Here's a message about COVID safety precautions from David Loveall, candidate for Lane County Commissioner (Springfield).

""Masks have truly become the black out window curtains to the soul.

William Shakespeare once said, “the eyes are the window to the soul” but lately, that's not enough for me. I need the rest of the facial details. I need those unique smiles. I miss the dimples formed by joy, I need the added tell-tale signs of life behind the piece of dining tablecloth adapted with ear loops. I can no longer tell if someone is either happy to see me from their eyes exclusively, or if that unibrow twitch is because they're trying to remember which pocket the switchblade knife is hiding.

The Message bible says, “your eyes are windows into your body. If you open your eyes wide in wonder and belief, your body fills up with light. If you live squinty-eyed in greed and distrust, your body is a dank cellar. If you pull THE BLINDS ON YOUR WINDOWS, what a dark life you will have.” Mathew 6:22-23

We humans need more that just the eyes to recognize who and what. We need to see, enjoy and take in the whole face, feeling the moment of greeting written across each person's window pane. If there's anything I wish most for this new year is the “rolling up” and “taking off” of masks...all of them, both spiritual, and actual.

My soul's aching to see the full soul window of people again...without the blinds...and I'm betting, so is the rest of the world too.

Blessings,
David Loveall"""

Hear me out.  I'm serious.  Making people go get needle shots every couple of months for boosters is a drag.  Nobody's gonna do that in the inner cities.  All they want to do is loot.  And that's where COVID variants breed and lie in wait for winter when they burst forth in a new variant.  So shall it ever be.  I know how to end this.  

To stop the virus, we need to MANDATE SUPPOSITORIES DAILY in the inner cities.  The plan will be to employ the hundreds of thousands of Mexicans and Third World Illegal Border Crossers to go out EVERY DAY to the inner city individuals they are assigned (on a block by block basis or zip code) and forcibly insert a blue virus suppository up everyone's anuses.  I've never pluralized the word anus so forgive me if I got that wrong.  The point is, illegal aliens will stick buttplugs of virus blockers up inner city residents buttholes, starting with Detroit, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia and also including the white elitist socialists in Portland.  They will all line up daily in the designated zones, with their pants down and asses up for efficient insertion of the anti-Covid virus suppositories.  

This, ladies and gentlemen, is how we defeat COVID where it breeds in the inner cities and mutates into variants.  If you want a better life, vote for DAILY FORCED SUPPOSITORIES in specific viral load zones in the inner shithole cities of this once great nation.
Furthermore, science shows that the more violent the insertion of the suppositories the better.  So we will need to recruit illegal aliens with some arm strength and agility.

HAPPY NEW YEAR.  I, your humble savior, will execute this plan immediately."

In 2010 we had David Cameron's big society, today we have Boris Johnsons levelling up. What we have never really had is a solution to the problem of poverty that has any more substance to it than a sound bite. Our Benefits system is designed to be as difficult to use as possible, forcing the unemployed and disabled into low wage jobs. Things are now so bad that I keep expecting a statement from Priti Patel announcing the return of the workhouse. 

Philip Alston, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, in his final report for the United Nations has said that Poverty is a Political Choice. That is certainly true in a country as wealthy as ours. There seems to be no shortage of money. The Bank of England has ""printed"" £1trillion over the last year in a quantitative easing (QE) stimulus package. Where the problem lies is in the distribution and entitlement to all the wealth. 

What real solutions are there available to us to end the poverty trap that so many find themselves in today? 

We propose as one of the cornerstones of our progressive policies a Citizens Income. This would be paid to all UK citizens regardless of their employment status putting an end to the benefits system, state pensions, family allowance, sickness benefits and food banks. Children's legal guardians would receive the child’s CI on their behalf up until the age of 16. All real poverty in society would finally be alleviated.

This would end unemployment as it is perceived today and retirement could be at the discretion of the individual. CI itself will not be taxed and all income over and above CI being taxed at the same flat rate. 

Having CI enables everyone to live at a basic level without the worry of becoming destitute through a lack of funds. The financial stability that CI brings would take the unnecessary stress out of everyday living, helping both families and individuals to fulfil their lives more productively. An augmented Citizen's Income (ACI) would be paid to those with disabilities. It will not be means-tested. Also, in recognition of their long years of service, a Seniority Supplement for all voters over the age of sixty-five will also be made. 

 CI is basically a dividend, as we are all shareholders in UK PLC. 

All well and good except that the amount of money this would cost is astronomical. So how could it be financed?

If CI was £10,000 a year for each adult and £5,000 for each child the cost of CI would equal that of the total annual tax revenue that the government currency receives. 

The Green party has a similar policy in their manifest that they would fund with a Carbon Tax. They do not however give an estimate as to how much extra revenue a Carbon Tax would bring. Whatever the amount such a tax would raise it could never be enough to finance a Citizens Income for all. So an alternative way of funding CI needs to be found other than creating a new tax or expecting general taxation on its own to be sufficient. 

 What is money and where does it come from?

We come here to an interesting question, what actually is money and where does it come from? If you do not already know you may be surprised by the answer. Only about 3% of money currently in circulation comes from the Bank of England. These are the coins and notes that we use that are made by the royal mint. The rest comes from debt and is made electronically by the banks when we borrow from them. 

If you use your bank overdraft or credit card, take out a personal loan or mortgage the credit that your bank extends to you is all new money. When Theresa May told the nurses that there was no magic money tree she was not being truthful. In fact, all our money comes from the magic tree, i.e. it comes out of nowhere. When we pay it back into our account the money that we have borrowed just disappears again. All that is left is the interest that our bank charges us. 

 A drawback with this system is that the Central Bank and the Government have little control over the money in the economy. So when things occasionally go wrong it can be costly to rectify the problem. 

The last economic crash is an example of this. Mostly caused by deregulation because past governments had decided that growth was more important than stability. George Osbourn when he became the Chancellor of the Exchequer decided to pay back the government borrowing that resulted from the bailout with an austerity program of reduced spending. Coupled with a tax cut for the rich to help stimulate growth. This was totally wrong thinking, the more governments spend the greater their income because it is their spending that stimulates economic growth. Therefore the bailout in the end cost us more than was necessary.  

QE has been used in the past to put money into the economy when the banks have stopped lending. The problem with QE is that it puts money into the markets when in fact it is most needed at the lower end of the economic spectrum. Another idea for solving this kind of liquidity trap is called a helicopter drop. Putting a lot of cash into the economy by Central Banks making payments directly to individuals. This has so far never been tried and is, like QE, a quick fix as opposed to a long term strategy for maintaining a stable economy. 

Direct monetary financing.

The Governments overdraft facility with the bank of England is a form of direct monetary financing. Instead of financing the Government indirectly with QE the Bank of England is now financing them directly. This has given them unlimited funds to fight Covid. But so far they have made no new Fiscal Policy that takes into account the possible ramifications of having unlimited credit. 

 A new idea that is being looked at by the worlds governments and central banks is Central bank digital currency (CBDC). We are all aware of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The difference between those and a CBDC is that a digital currency made by a central bank would be guaranteed by them. So £50 in your central bank digital account would always be worth the same as a £50 note in your wallet. 

Everyone having a CBDC account would give the Bank of England the ability to helicopter drop money directly into the economy if liquidity had become a problem and the economy was stagnating.  

CBDC accounts however could alternatively be used as a way of paying CI to all citizens. Without undermining the role that the banks play in generating credit and being a safe place for savings and for making bill payments. 

 What are the dangers?

Putting too much new money into the economy can devalue the pound and cause inflation. This is where taxation comes in. Taxation is the most affected way of removing surplus cash from the economy. Setting tax rates at the right level as well as interest rates can keep the currency stabilised. With the added ability to put more money in should it be needed. Giving far more control over the economy than is currently possible. 

Five small countries already have a CBDC. St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Lucia, Grenada and the Bahama’s. We should not expect it to be long before larger economies such as ours do the same thing. Why not use this opportunity to create a Citizens Income for all and end poverty for good.

And if you don't live #UpNorth but are concern about voter suppression in Wisconsin, please share this podcast to your friends and family in Northern Wisconsin.

Last week, Pat, Sarah, and Kirk spoke with Hans Breiten Moser. 

Hans is known to most folks in Wisconsin as the ""Fair Maps Hero,"" but he is also a member of the Lincoln County Board. 

Hans was worried about an upsurge of angry neighbors who believe in the ""Big Lie"" who were running for board seats in his county.

He worried that their goal in wanting to sit on county board seats was not to actually manage the affairs of the county, but to gain local power over future elections at the local level.

This is obviously concerning, because people who falsely believe the ""Big Lie,"" and blindly follow Trump, a ridiculous false prophet,  should definitely NOT be given the power to put their feet on the scales of local elections.

So in this episode we implore any civic minded folks who want to ensure that local government remains fair and democratic become candidates for your own county boards.

Nomination papers are available throughout the month of December and for most counties, you only need 20 signatures to get on the ballot.  

If you have questions, call your county clerk or your county Democratic Party office.

13 In accordance with God’s promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.

Not to scandalize you, but there is a sacrilegious joke I want to tell you:  Not to shock you, but to redeem its punch line.  

The joke, which is a riff on end-time Christianity, goes like this:  “Jesus is coming.  Look busy.”  It’s not a great joke, but I think it has a truth that can bless us.  Jesus is coming.  Look busy – or, better yet, get busy.  Get to work doing what Jesus wants us to do to make this world welcome for him –and for us all.  

That is what Advent is all about.  Advent is a season of preparation to make the way ready for the King of kings and Lord of lords.  If only I was as intentional about doing that as Home Depot is.  

The first Christmas items appeared at Home Depot before Labor Day.  Go in there today and you’ll find the place plastered with poinsettias and home decorations and artificial trees and on and on and on.

If I was as serious about making Jesus welcome as Home Depot is about making a buck, my faith would really move mountains.

The journalist Nicholas Kristof has an annual column about alternative Christmas giving.  This year he touted a project called Cure Blindness, which offers cataract surgery for poor people in Asia and Africa.  $50 will restore a person’s sight.  

Another organization Campaign for Female Education seeks to get African girls in school – and out of child marriages.  $150 will educate a girl for one year in high school.  $30 will cover a year of elementary school.  This program has enabled 157,000 young African women to get their education and to pay it forward because each graduate mentors and sponsors another girl.  Talk about changing the world!

Yes, there is only one Savior of the world.  But, by the grace of God, it is amazing what we can do to help in that saving work.  The Youth Service Bureau’s Project ReinDEAR, the local CASA program, sponsoring a child through Compassion International.  Think of all the wonderful ways we can be about the Lord’s work by making things just a little bit more right and good and just and loving.

See if you can include some alternative Christmas gifts in your gifting this year.  Instead of another sweater, Uncle Harold might really like a Heifer Project duck.  Cousin Mary might appreciate a gift being given in her name – rather than receiving a gift herself.  Try it and see how that changes the feel and meaning of Christmas for you – for good.

We’re in the middle of a pandemic, an economic crisis, and a poisonous political climate.  All of that can make us feel pretty powerless.  After all, none of us is going to come up the cure for Covid-19.  But we can wear a mask and practice social distancing while we wait for the vaccine to arrive, which thankfully is on its way.  Doing what we can do while we wait is a God-given power all of us have.  

And that is what God wants us to do while we wait for God’s kingdom to come in full:  We are to anticipate that reality, which only God can bring, by doing those things, which only we can do.  As we do what is within our power to do, we prepare the way and hasten that day when our Savior fully reigns; when righteousness is truly at home; when this tired, old universe and sin-sick world are transformed into a new heavens and a new earth.

If you think that our power to prepare the way for something that big is just a lot of hype, then you have a bunch of geophysicists who will disagree with you.  During the lock down earlier this year when we all stayed home, geologists who monitor tremors and watch for earthquakes reported that the lock down actually decreased the amount of surface tremor for the entire planet.  Turns out that when 7 billion people do something small, it adds up to something that is pretty big.

Don’t underestimate what God can and will do in and through you.  Your actions have consequences.  And when you act with God, eternally powerful things happen.  Getting sober.  Forgiving an enemy.  Burying a grudge.  Mentoring a child.  Living with hope.  Sharing in love.  These gospel acts are the basic building blocks of the Kingdom of God.

So, don’t just spend this month getting ready for Christmas.  Get ready for your Savior.  Welcome him.  Don’t wait passively.  Do what you can – where you are – as the Lord leads you.

As you do, you will welcome Christ into your life, which shall be blessed, and into the world, which shall be changed.  Let us prepare the way.

In reading this, your heart may be stirred. What you’re feeling is the Holy Spirit drawing you to Christ. To begin or renew a relationship with Jesus, just pray:

""Lord, help me receive your love. I regret the wrong I’ve done. Forgive me. Jesus, I believe you are God’s Son and the Savior of the world.  Be my Savior.  Save me from myself.  Save me for yourself.  Enter my heart.  Fill me with your Holy Spirit.  Help me to serve you faithfully and well. Help me to love as you love.  Lead me in your Way, Truth, and Life now and forever.  Continue to show me who you are and who I am in you.  Amen.""

Well this is interesting. First off, I want you to look at the letters in red at the top of the first page of this document. ""ALDERMEN CONFIDENTIAL... closed record"".

This document was never meant to be revealed to the citizens of Parkville. Why is that? Well, I have a few questions.

-  Why is the Board of Aldermen planning to build a new ""luxury"" apartment complex next to the river, inside a floodplain?

-  Why are they using the same development firm that destroyed Kansas City's formerly beautiful Berkley Riverfront Park?

-  Does the Board of Aldermen think they're spending Monopoly money?

-  What will be the impact on English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park?

-  What will be the impact of extra traffic on Downtown Parkville?

-  Will this benefit the community as a whole, or will it just make an already wealthy developer even more wealthy?

Implications of building this apartment complex inside a floodplain

Information from a current Parkville resident...

""Flooding is generally the most common and costliest type of disaster Missouri experiences, but standard homeowner's insurance does not cover flooding, so it's important to have protection from damage associated with flooding.

SEMA's Floodplain Management Section administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for the state of Missouri.  NFIP offers flood insurance to homeowners, renters and business owners if their community participates in the program, providing more than $4 billion in flood insurance coverage for Missouri homes and business annually. Participating communities agree to adopt and enforce floodplain management ordinances that meet or exceed FEMA requirements.""

So the long and short of it is, Parkville taxpayers, you and me, will have to pay $4,000,000 in added taxes for flood insurance.

Impact on Parkville's parks

If you remember Berkley Park in Kansas City, before Flaherty & Collins came in and covered it with apartments, it was a large, beautiful park on the river with many events, festivals, concerts, etc. It was a place where people could gather with their families. Now... nothing really happens there. The only use is for people to walk the river trail. Is this what we want for English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park? I think not.

Impact on the businesses in Downtown Parkville

Traffic coming through Downtown Parkville can already be congested. This new ""stack 'em & pack 'em"" apartment complex would turn downtown and the roads leading into it into a virtual parking lot. The businesses there are already struggling, trying to come out of the COVID restrictions placed on them by the County Health Board. Deterring shoppers from coming into Downtown by creating huge traffic blockages would put the final nail in the coffin for them. This is just common sense. Anyone can see that, except our Board of Aldermen. Or maybe they do see it and they just don't care.

Benefit to the community?

So the citizens of Parkville will be on the hook for $4,000,000 in increased taxes. It will ruin English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park. That means no more events downtown. Parkville Days... gone. Fourth of July events... gone. Parkville Microbrew Festival... gone. Downtown shopping... gone. These all promote and bring people into the city to spend money.

Also, how does providing the developer, Flaherty & Collins, $1.5 million - $2 million in incentives to build this monstrosity benefit the community as a whole? The answer? It doesn't.

So why would the Board of Aldermen even consider this plan? And why would they want to keep it secret? What else is City Hall hiding from us?

This is a prime example of why we need a change in City Hall. This is why we need to be ""in the room"" when these things are being discussed. This is why there should be NO private, ""confidential"" meetings. When it comes to issues that are going to have a massive impact on the community and businesses of the city, there should be maximum transparency and community oversight.

It doesn't matter to me how things have always been done. If elected Mayor of Parkville, I will put you ""in the room"". I will be your voice. And if the Board of Aldermen don't like that? Tough. I won't stand by and allow them to Kansas City our Parkville."

Greetings from the Literacy Council of Benton County
in this last week of 2021!

    Rafe, 45, and Sam, 34, each bought their first house this past year because their LCBC tutor helped them understand the language of the process.

    Because Daisy’s tutor helped her find an affordable phone service, she was able to hear back from a local employer and is now working for the first time in several years.

    Fatima and Daniela became U.S. Citizens this year; and two more students are beginning their Citizenship exam preparation.

    LCBC is beginning to tutor Afghan refugees; we have 5 now!

     Community support made these lasting changes happen.  Less than 15% of our operating budget comes from government funding; the rest we must raise from foundations, churches, and friends like you.

     The most recent statistics from ProLiteracy America tell us that 23% of adults in Benton County are functionally illiterate in English.  Most of our students are from other countries; some have no schooling past the 4th grade while others are highly educated but want to improve their English skills.  We are diverse!

     The past two years were hard for many small non-profits like LCBC.  But our volunteer tutors kept at it, either on the phone, or Zooming, or meeting students here at LCBC with Covid protocols in place.  The tutors are heroes!

     We have recently had a large uptick in the number of both students seeking our help and generous people wanting to become tutors.  The need to be able to clearly communicate with friends, neighbors, lawmakers, teachers, police, and coworkers is more important than ever as we work to solve our country’s problems.

     The last two years we couldn’t hold in-person fundraising events, and that’s still up in the air due to the Omicron variant.  We’ve cut staff hours and scaled back on the purchase of books for our students at a time when our waiting list hovers around 90 students.  

     We need your help.  Please go to our secure website at www.goliteracy.org and click the donate now button.  Thank you for your consideration and time!

Happy New Year!

Governor Holcomb recently offered to end the state of emergency IF the legislature will create laws that mirror a state of emergency, including caveats that make it easier to vaccinate our young children for Covid19 and welcome federal funding along with the strings attached.

Governor Holcomb is offering to trade his temporary holding of power in exchange for permanent government overreach!

This is not reasonable or acceptable.

The citizens of Indiana have spoken via the ballot box and, in doing so, elected a Republican supermajority in both the House and Senate.
 
There should be no need to compromise regarding our freedom.

Enough is enough. Sign the petition today to #ENDIT!"

The Spring River Bridge on Garden has been completely replaced.  This is the first bridge replacement in town in decades.  This bridge replacement was completely paid for with City funds after Governor Grisham vetoed State funding for this project. The bridge over the arroyo in front of Roswell Livestock Auction is the next bridge to be replaced.

A complete rebuild of Atkinson north of Second Street is currently underway.  After the project on Atkinson is finished, Garden will be redone. That will include replacing the bridge over the arroyo in front of Roswell Livestock Auction. Garden has also had extensive replacement of waterlines.

We did a mill and fill on South Washington from McGaffey to Alameda.  We are requesting funding to go all the way to 8th Street.

Covid put a halt on many of our street projects.  We lost contractors, and there was concern about funding.  We are now back, and we have put more money into streets than has ever been done before."

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is under fire again over the latest reports of an alleged illegal party during the first lockdown.

As the rest of the country was subject to strict lockdown measures and sacrificed so much - visiting sick or grieving relatives, funerals - the prime minister's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, invited over 100 people to a ""bring your own booze"" party on 20 May 2020.

The PM is reported to have attended the event with his wife Carrie, at a time when restrictions in England banned all outdoor gatherings. An hour before the party, Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden, told members of the public via a live news conference about the Covid-19 outbreak: 

""You can meet one person outside your household in an outdoor, public place, provided that you stay two metres apart.""

The party was scheduled just five days after another cheese-and-wine social reportedly in the same venue. These incidents are currently under investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gary.

Campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice wrote to Boris Johnson urging him to ""do the right thing"" and say whether he attended the garden party and calling on him to apologise for ""smirking"" when asked about it during a TV interview.

Senior Conservatives have turned on Boris Johnson over the ""partygate"" scandal. The leader of Conservatives in Scotland, Douglas Ross, said the Prime Minister ""must resign"" if he misled Parliament and breached his own Government's Covid rules by attending the Downing Street party.

Former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson called for an immediate explanation from the Prime Minister, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused the Prime Minister of ""lying"" to the public.

An overwhelming two-thirds (66 per cent) of voters - including 42 per cent of those who backed Conservatives in 2019 - polled by Savanta ComRes said that Boris Johnson should resign over the issue.

Police forces in England and Wales issued 14,244 fines for breaches of lockdown laws between 27 March and 11 May 2020, according to figures from the National Police Chiefs' Council.

In the House of Commons, many MPs told how they and their constituents had been unable to support loved ones. DUP MP Jim Shannon emotionally described how his mother-in-law died alone as relatives obeyed lockdown rules.

We want politicians to hear from you - do you support or oppose Downing Street holding a BYOB (bring-your-own-booze) party during the Covid lockdown?

I am now officially going to be on the ballot to be your next Judge of the County Court at Law #3!

It is my goal and I would be honored to proudly represent ALL of the wonderful people of Smith County if I am elected! 

The CCL3 hears about 65% criminal cases and I am the only candidate with the recent criminal experience necessary to begin hearing those cases on DAY ONE. 

I am also the only candidate with recent felony jury trial experience, giving me the ability and confidence to work with the District Courts to alleviate some of their backlog caused by Covid-19 (and maybe save the taxpayers some money). 

Finally, I’m the only candidate with judicial experience and I am prepared to treat ALL parties who come before the Court fairly, equally, and respectfully. 

If you would like to get involved or if you’d like to know more, please visit trose4judge.com. Thank you for your continued prayers and support.

Election Day - March 1, 2022. 
Early Voting Starts - February 14, 2022."

When creating Crown on Down, I was inspired by Lisa Price, owner of Carol's Daughter, who also produces all natural hair care products, and I then realized that there are a lot of natural hair care products for black hair, but not a lot or enough natural hair care black owners. That alone made my product my purpose with a purpose. Another one of my missions accomplished.

We will not follow you into captivity. You are separating from those of us who value freedom. This is a very important moment in Time. Pay close attention and think critically.

You are agreeing to give control over your body to #TwoFacedLiars.

Please take time to do some self reflection. Consider how you have changed since the introduction of the Coronavirus into your life.

Consider all the lies.

The virus was new; definitely from nature. It started spreading in December, with the first cases in January 2020. Fauci knew nothing about it, but was absolutely certain it didn't come from the lab. Don't wear a mask. Then, wear a cloth mask. Definitely no mandates. Definitely back to usual when we have vaccines.

This is how liars operate. You are being deceived by our government. They are hurting you. They are lying to you. Fauci, Biden, and many other political bureaucrats have been engaged in a full blown Live Lab Test on the American people. They're testing a #NewVaccineTechnology that was way too dangerous for such widespread use prior to the release of the Coronavirus. Our own government has ownership in the Coronavirus vaccine technology. It's their baby. They birthed their rotten baby on the American people.

Everything they have done since March 2019, when this rotten plan was hatched, has been for the express purpose of spreading the virus as much as possible, so they could claim success with the vaccines. They deployed a lightweight version, knowing that herd immunity would be reached quickly and quietly, so as to keep people in the dark. Then, after months of miserable lockdowns that helped spread the virus, people were so desperate they would accept their rotten vaccine technology without question.

They made us miserable so we would happily accept a New Vaccine Technology under Emergency Use Authorization, regardless of whether or not we needed it. They locked us up and provided their vaccines as a key to our freedom.

Those who agreed to participate in this lie are not free. You are bound by a lie.

I strongly encourage you to ditch your Vaccine Passport, and only wear a mask for honest reasons.

This is indeed the times warned of in Revelations because this entire thing is based on lies. The whole thing. The masks are a lie. Cloth masks do not protect you from the Coronavirus. Everyone wearing a cloth mask for protection from the Coronavirus is wearing a lie. That lie is tearing our country apart.

Most people do not need a vaccine for protection from Covid-19, yet most people are getting it anyway. Those who are doing so for the purpose of praise, to show others, are leading people towards the father of lies. You are wearing the mark.

The mark represents a lie. It's Satan's team symbol.

Wearing a mask for any reason other than the absolute truth is to wear a lie/mark.

Injecting a Coronavirus vaccine into your body because you want to show others, while claiming that you are doing it because you honestly believe that you need it, is to inject a lie into your body. You will know in your heart if you are being honest. That's between you and God.

Mistakes happen. Should you find yourself wondering why you got the vaccine or are wearing a mask, it's a good time to start asking God to help you find your mistakes. Pray for Truth. God loves Truth.

10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

Revelation 13:10

8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

Revelation 14:8–12

12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing

Revelation 5:12

12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name

But is it that simple? 

When dealing with such topics as Cancer, COVID-19, Vaccine & Masking Mandates, Protecting Children – you may have questions! If you do, we recommend the Feb 4 & 5 ‘Faith & Medicine Conference’ at Grace Fellowship in Cumming, GA. 

Cancer. Approximately 39.5% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetime. One of the conference hosts is HealingStrong. Their mission is to connect, support and educate individuals facing cancer and other diseases through strategies that help to rebuild the body, restore the soul and renew the spirit through true healing and wholeness. 

COVID-19. There is growing concern about the integrity and motives of the healthcare system due to recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Only the light of God’s word can dispel the darkness. Let’s cling to Biblical and critical thinking in illness and healthcare, along with God’s redeeming love. 

Protecting Children. How do we protect our children during these alarming times and threats to their medical freedom and ours? How do we provide the best care to our children, while addressing ethics in medicine? 

For valuable insight in these and other areas, please join us at the 2022 'Faith and Medicine Conference'. You can conveniently register online for in-person or livestream attendance for every conference session.

DAVID CIRENCIONE LAUNCHES CANDIDACY FOR ONTARIO COUNTY SHERIFF!

Today David Cirencione launched his candidacy for Ontario County Sheriff in the 2022 election. A Republican and lifelong resident of Ontario County, he is a 20-year veteran of the Sheriff’s Office and currently serves as Lieutenant, overseeing the Criminal Investigation Division.

“I’m running for Sheriff because my 20 years of law enforcement experience and leadership will bring stability back to the Sheriff’s Office,” said Cirencione. “I’ve dedicated my life to serving – as a police officer, as a volunteer firefighter, and as a husband and father – and this is a natural next step to utilize my skills and experience to make Ontario County a safer place to live, work, raise a family and retire.”

Cirencione first joined the Sheriff’s Office in 2002 as a Deputy. Over the years, he was promoted through the ranks to Sergeant in 2007 and eventually his current rank in 2016. As Lieutenant for the past five years, he has served as Commanding Officer of the Road Patrol, Crime Scene Unit, Underwater Search & Recovery Team, Field Training Officer Program and Eastview Mall Patrol. He has also helped train our next generation of law enforcement as an Instructor at the Finger Lakes Law Enforcement Academy for the past 16 years.

“Now more than ever before, the Ontario County Sheriff’s Office must operate effectively and efficiently, as the COVID pandemic continues to strain our emergency services and Albany politicians enact dangerous policies like bail reform that seem to value criminals more than crime victims,” added Cirencione. “I’m ready to step up to the plate to take on these challenges and lead our Sheriff’s Office back in the right direction.”

Aside from his extensive law enforcement background, Cirencione has served as a volunteer firefighter with the Nester Hose Company of the Geneva Fire Department for 28 years. He is also a member of the Sons of the American Legion Winnek Post 396 and Our Lady of Peace Parish.

Before entering a career in law enforcement, Cirencione served for several years as a Caseworker and Case Supervisor for Child Protective Services in neighboring Seneca County.

Cirencione, 46, is a graduate of Geneva High School and SUNY Oswego. He lives in Geneva with his wife of 20 years, Sue, who owns and operates the Ovid Big M supermarket. The couple has three children."

January 19, 2022

Good Wednesday morning. Welcome to RUPP'S NOTES/FBI SPECIAL AGENT HARTMANN SERIES' weekly post. I'm the author Richard V. Rupp, writing from Burbank, California. 

Robocalls are driving me nuts. I suspect it has something to do with the work-from-home thing. Both in who is making the calls and the fact more people are at home to receive them. Over the past couple of weeks, I averaged six to eight a day. 

Today's post is an example of what I did for a living many years ago. Advise management based on my research on what changes may impact the business in the foreseeable future. But instead of writing a report to senior insurance company management, I will present what I foresee to you and use some of the material in my upcoming novel SKYWARD. 

Significant factors that I believe will impact the new normal are 1. Impact of the changing of the guard as Millennials and Gen-Z's take over running things; 2. This is a shrinking world caused by overpopulation and decreased usable landmass due to climate change, 3. The darkening of the populations' complexion caused by migration and changing birthrates; 4. A move toward socialist structure; 5. A move away from fossil fuels, and 6. Yes, the long-term impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

An example of what the pandemic has done is the consideration by Lloyd's of London to move from their flagship City of London headquarters. (I spend a lot of time in both the original Lloyds building and its 1986 replacement tower designed by British architect Richard Rogers.) Why the move? Because the pandemic speeded up, Lloyds move to automation and away from doing business on its underwriting floor. A Lloyd's spokesperson said, ""As we adapt to new structures and flexible ways of working, we are continuing to carefully think about the future requirements for the spaces and services our marketplace needs. ""Like many other organizations, we are considering a range of options around our workspace strategy and the future leasing arrangements for Lloyd's."" Companies are reassessing their office space as the COVID-19 pandemic showed working from home was viable. Lloyd's is just one example of how businesses have been impacted and why office space is now being converted to apartments and condos. 

Millennials and Z's don't live in the past and, except for scientific advancements, consider historical, social information of little value. Like my dad used to tell me, ""Don't look in the rearview mirror unless you want to go that way."" Millennials and Z's are either looking ahead or are looking at a metaverse (unreal or make-believe world). This is evident because they don't believe traditional higher education is of value. In fact, they think it may slow down their advancement in the world. This fall has seen the sharpest enrolment decline among people 24 and older into four-year colleges, according to Clearinghouse data. They see their peers entering the working world through inventiveness tied to electronic devices. Doug Shapiro, executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, said in an interview. ""Students are questioning the value of college. They may be looking at friends who graduated last year or the year before who didn't go, and they seem to be doing fine."" 

The above concept is also seen in reading habits change. A December 2021 Gallup poll indicates that fewer people are reading books. The average American adult read just over 12 books in 2021, the smallest average number than any prior survey dating back to 1990. The number of big readers has dropped hard, and that's what's weighing on the overall average. ""Currently, just 27 % report that they read more than 10 books,"" Gallup says, ""down eight percentage points since 2016 and lower than every prior measure by at least four points."" That decline was particularly marked among college graduates and older readers. I had to laugh at an article that indicated, ""Men are finally catching up to women when it comes to book reading! That's only because women are reading fewer books."" The Gallup editors conclude, ""Reading appears to be in decline as a favorite way for Americans to spend their free time."" 

Millennials and Z's also tie religion to the past and have placed it on the chopping block. A recent Pew Research Center report indicates that the number of Americans with no religious affiliation has nearly doubled over the past 14 years, from 16% to 29%. Self-identified Christians dropped from 78% to 63% during the same period. 

Most Americans believe U.S. democracy is in danger. According to a Brookings report, one in five Americans has views that make them at least open to, if not outright supportive of, authoritarianism. According to CNN, -74% of us are angry about the state of the nation, and USA Today indicates that only 14% of us think things are going well. 46% think civil war is likely, and we are split about equal as to dividing the country into two parts (Aogby Analytics). ABC News says 70% of us believe the economy is doing poorly. And 55% have been adversely affected by inflation. Yet, according to a Gallup survey, 59% of Americans say they are currently ""thriving"" – the highest number in 13 years. 

The use by large corporations of bots, A.I., and automation, in general, will significantly increase as the attitude of the workforce changes, pushed by the pandemic. A record number of U.S. workers have quit their jobs in the past few months. More than 4.5 million people voluntarily walked away from their positions in November, up from 4.2 million in October. November's figure was the highest since the government started tracking the figure two decades ago. 

Government regulations to curb the use of fossil fuels and infrastructure investments will increase the use of electric vehicles and drones. The inefficiencies of wind and solar energy will renew the interest in nuclear power. 

The United States and China will dramatically expand their military drones and bots' technology. The newly developed weapon systems will significantly change warfare. The U.S. may test these new weapon systems in Ukraine (with the U.S. providing advisors to Ukraine) if Russian troops invade. 

Finally, all of the above convinces me that increased inflation (6%-8%) will be with us for the next couple of years. It was at 7% in December. The cost of food (my steaks at Costco have gone up 40%), apparel, and especially used cars are draining our wallets a lot faster. The Federal Reserve is on high alert for how this could affect the economy. 

Back to researching, thinking, and using the above info in my novel SKYWARD. 

Please, be kind to each other, and stay safe. 

Cheers,

have never really had is a solution to the problem of poverty that has any more substance to it than a sound bite Our Benefits system is designed to be as difficult to use as possible forcing the unemployed and disabled into low wage jobs Things are now so bad that I keep expecting a statement from Priti Patel announcing the return of the workhouse Philip Alston the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights in his final report for the United Nations has said that Poverty is a Political Choice That is certainly true in a country as wealthy as ours There seems to be no shortage of money The Bank of England has printed trillion over the last year in a quantitative easing QE stimulus package Where the problem lies is in the distribution and entitlement to all the wealth What real solutions are there available to us to end the poverty trap that so many find themselves in today We propose as one of the cornerstones of our progressive policies a Citizens Income This would be paid to all UK citizens regardless of their employment status putting an end to the benefits system state pensions family allowance sickness benefits and food banks Children s legal guardians would receive the child s CI on their behalf up until the age of All real poverty in society would finally be alleviated This would end unemployment as it is perceived today and retirement could be at the discretion of the individual CI itself will not be taxed and all income over and above CI being taxed at the same flat rate Having CI enables everyone to live at a basic level without the worry of becoming destitute through a lack of funds The financial stability that CI brings would take the unnecessary stress out of everyday living helping both families and individuals to fulfil their lives more productively An augmented Citizen s Income ACI would be paid to those with disabilities It will not be means tested Also in recognition of their long years of service a Seniority Supplement for all voters over the age of sixty five will also be made CI is basically a dividend as we are all shareholders in UK PLC All well and good except that the amount of money this would cost is astronomical So how could it be financed If CI was a year for each adult and for each child the cost of CI would equal that of the total annual tax revenue that the government currency receives The Green party has a similar policy in their manifest that they would fund with a Carbon Tax They do not however give an estimate as to how much extra revenue a Carbon Tax would bring Whatever the amount such a tax would raise it could never be enough to finance a Citizens Income for all So an alternative way of funding CI needs to be found other than creating a new tax or expecting general taxation on its own to be sufficient What is money and where does it come from We come here to an interesting question what actually is money and where does it come from If you do not already know you may be surprised by the answer Only about of money currently in circulation comes from the Bank of England These are the coins and notes that we use that are made by the royal mint The rest comes from debt and is made electronically by the banks when we borrow from them If you use your bank overdraft or credit card take out a personal loan or mortgage the credit that your bank extends to you is all new money When Theresa May told the nurses that there was no magic money tree she was not being truthful In fact all our money comes from the magic tree i e it comes out of nowhere When we pay it back into our account the money that we have borrowed just disappears again All that is left is the interest that our bank charges us A drawback with this system is that the Central Bank and the Government have little control over the money in the economy So when things occasionally go wrong it can be costly to rectify the problem The last economic crash is an example of this Mostly caused by deregulation because past governments had decided that growth was more important than stability George Osbourn when he became the Chancellor of the Exchequer decided to pay back the government borrowing that resulted from the bailout with an austerity program of reduced spending Coupled with a tax cut for the rich to help stimulate growth This was totally wrong thinking the more governments spend the greater their income because it is their spending that stimulates economic growth Therefore the bailout in the end cost us more than was necessary QE has been used in the past to put money into the economy when the banks have stopped lending The problem with QE is that it puts money into the markets when in fact it is most needed at the lower end of the economic spectrum Another idea for solving this kind of liquidity trap is called a helicopter drop Putting a lot of cash into the economy by Central Banks making payments directly to individuals This has so far never been tried and is like QE a quick fix as opposed to a long term strategy for maintaining a stable economy Direct monetary financing The Governments overdraft facility with the bank of England is a form of direct monetary financing Instead of financing the Government indirectly with QE the Bank of England is now financing them directly This has given them unlimited funds to fight Covid But so far they have made no new Fiscal Policy that takes into account the possible ramifications of having unlimited credit A new idea that is being looked at by the worlds governments and central banks is Central bank digital currency CBDC We are all aware of Bitcoin and other digital currencies The difference between those and a CBDC is that a digital currency made by a central bank would be guaranteed by them So in your central bank digital account would always be worth the same as a note in your wallet Everyone having a CBDC account would give the Bank of England the ability to helicopter drop money directly into the economy if liquidity had become a problem and the economy was stagnating CBDC accounts however could alternatively be used as a way of paying CI to all citizens Without undermining the role that the banks play in generating credit and being a safe place for savings and for making bill payments What are the dangers Putting too much new money into the economy can devalue the pound and cause inflation This is where taxation comes in Taxation is the most affected way of removing surplus cash from the economy Setting tax rates at the right level as well as

While we’re all eager to get back to a more normal life, many are struggling to keep up with the high cost of living.

While several employees rallied and pleaded against the measure, Ector County Hospital board voted 4-3 to comply with a mandate that requires its hospital employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or lose millions in federal funding.

CEO of Medical Center Hospital, Russell Tippin, stated that roughly 65% of its staff is fully vaccinated and those that are not vaccinated have until January  5 to be fully vaccinated or have an exemption approved by a hospital committee. The deadline to file an exemption is November 23rd, less than a week away.  Tippin stated that he had some 2000 plus employees that needed to be vaccinated by the deadline or the hospital could face the possibility of decreasing the number of procedures it schedules to half the normal schedule.

Federal funding for Medical Center Hospital was also placed in jeopardy recently by a hospital policy.  The policy drafted more than a year ago instructed hospital employees to place bags over certain Covid patients heads.  A photo that went viral shows a 16 year old girl, wearing a mask, with an equipment cover bag over her head and extended down around her waist. She can be seen appearing defeated looking down holding an oxygen hose in her hand.  The girl complained of having trouble breathing for more than 30 minutes but was told the mask and bag had to stay in place.  The nurse admitted to having forgotten to attach the hose to the oxygen supply. The young girl was later admitted to ICU with oxygen levels in the mid 80’s.  She was instructed to save the bag and reuse it throughout her stay.  Each time she was taken from her room the bag was placed over her head.  This has caused her severe anxiety, PTSD and shame.  The 16 year old honor roll student who was very active in school activities found herself unable to tolerate crowds and was forced to withdraw from school.  The once outgoing teen is now a recluse spending many hours alone in her room.  The mother stated that she could never have imagined a short term ordeal would cause her daughter such long term anxiety.  Through support and counseling her mother hopes she will make a full recovery.  A complaint was filed with the Texas Department of State Health Services."

I have read and appreciate each and every one of them. It is important that citizens are engaged and, regardless of your position, let elected officials know your thoughts.

I do want to be clear and let everyone know where I stand specifically in reference to the mask mandate. Prior to being elected in November, I campaigned on being a champion for parental rights. Having said that, I will only support optional mask wearing. If parents want to have their children masked, they certainly are entitled to that right and, with that, parents who choose to not have their children masked should also have that same right extended to them.

I am aware of Governor Youngkin’s Executive Order and SB1303. Senator Dunnavant, the patron of that bi-partisan legislation, who is a practicing physician, stated this legislation was not intended to force school systems to follow CDC recommendations regarding masks. (Hint: The word recommendation is important here.) SB1303 also uses terms, such as “to the maximum extent possible” which lends itself to interpretation.

Having said that, I do believe we must continue to be diligent in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID. My suggestions to the Board have included ideas such as: improved air quality measures (air filtration systems, UV lighting, etc.); increased on-site testing in schools (VISSTA, a model already being used by other localities in Virginia); and ongoing physical distancing and sanitation measures.

I look forward to today’s retreat and robust conversation with fellow board members regarding the above-mentioned thoughts. I am hopeful we can walk away with a plan that ends mask mandates while still working to keep children and families in Augusta County safe and well."

""Back in March before the pandemic, I was living in Spain and was supposed to volunteer in South Africa, but because of Covid I couldn't go. This year, now that I'm back in Mexico I was thinking which destination I could go to. I saw Peru on IVHQ's website and knew barely anything about it, just that they had another Wonder of the World (Machu Picchu). ✨

Being in the #Childcare program was a unique experience. I was placed in a tiny town north if Cusco. It's so small that even Peruvians in Cusco had not heard of it! The children in the town were so excited to have a teacher - most of them hadn't gone to school since March 2020, before the pandemic hit. Outside of volunteering, I made great friends and so many unique memories - plus there's so many different places to visit in Cusco!""

We live in an era where the system of global capitalism is riven by multiple crises. The capitalist economy is wracked by a long term crisis of low profitabilty. We face an existential climate and environmental catastrophe brought on by fossil fuel capitalism. Covid has shown how vulnerable our societies are to the newly emerging viral pandemics. Meanwhile the threat of imperialist war looms, and the super rich continue to prosper while those at the bottom of society face poverty, exploitation and insecurity. 
How relevant are the ideas of Karl Marx to the world in the 21st century and to struggles for social justice today? 
 Our online event ""Marxism 101: an introduction to the revolutionary ideas of Karl Marx""  will provide an outline to some of Karl Marx's key ideas and allow for a discussion about how well his his fit today.

I am Kartik Bhatt, and I am running to be your next Labor Commissioner. I live with my wife Twisha my daughter Namasvi and my parents Harikrishna V Bhatt, Hirnaxi H Bhatt in Acworth GA. We have been residents of Cobb County since 2001.

America is a land of opportunity for those who talented and hard-working. And I am a living, breathing example of that. This land has provided me and family a wonderful life with plenty of prospects that I look forward to. It is my time to give back and serve this nation and all of its citizens, particularly the state of state and Georgians who welcomed me with open arms. I intend to do that to the best of my ability in steering this office towards truth, trust and transparency.

My journey in the United States had very humble beginnings. I landed in USA in August of 2001 in pursuit of the American dream. A month after we landed here, I began working at Publix Supermarket in the Front-end Department as a bagger and cart pusher. In Jan of 2002 I had the opportunity to work as Cashier at Walmart Supercenter. In 2007, I was blessed to get opportunity to serve at the Cobb County Department of Public Safety as an animal control officer.
 
Life took a turn when my family entered real estate business in 2013. And of the most significant roles of my career was the honor and opportunity provided by our Honorable Governor Brian Kemp to serve on the Board of Examiners for the Certification of Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators and Laboratory Analysts and I have been committed completely to serving the people of this peach state. In 2020, I had the opportunity to be the first Indian American Honorary Driver at the US President Motorcade.

WHY IAM RUNNING FOR OFFICE
I am a Conservative Public Servant and not a carrier politician. I am running for Labor Commissioner, inspired by India’s philosopher and author of political treatise Arthashastra, Archarya Chanakya, who urged the youth to join politics instead of complaining about what is not right for the country to clean up the system. 

MY GOALS AND PLANS:
My main goal is to ensure that hardworking Georgians are financially independent. I believe this is the right time to safeguard the future and it begins with each and every employee of each and every company. My goal is to create a plan that engages, excites and empowers the labor force to perform better and contribute to their companies, which will further contribute to the growth and prosperity of the state.

My first step includes restoring broken relationships and building trust between my Office and hardworking Georgians. Towards this end I will create a Community Engagement Team which will engage the community and the issues and address them appropriately. 

I truly believe that good leadership happens not by instruction, but by inspiration. Along with my team, I will also get involved personally. I encourage one-on-one meeting with me one person a week to meet me at my office for 10 to 15 min without an appointment.

I believe that we all are children of God and are therefore family in the truest sense no matter our Race or Ethnicity.  Every 2 months, I plan to host a Multicultural Community meeting to connect with Georgia leaders from various cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The Goal is to discuss how we can all work together with Integrity to foster innovations and invest in the state of Georgia.

As someone who started their career as a cart pusher, I can relate to employee feelings on a personal level. I will ensure that any employee working on Sundays, Nights or any holidays will be paid $1.00 extra per hour. I believe that these people are working for us and we should be thankful for their services. 

EMPOWERING BUSINESSES

I extend my full support to business Owners, small medium or large. In talking to a lot of small business owners, I learned that sba loans and commercial loans process banks takes approximately 60 to 90 days. As your Labor commissioner i will work with banks and lenders and make this process 30 to 45 days with poplar documents. If banks and lenders are closing resident loans for 30 days then why not SBA and commercial loans?  I plan to look into this within first 100 days of my office.

Business owners to plan to initiate imports and exports, or plan on bringing in business from another state or country will have my full support.

I will work with Government agencies to find ways the Government can reduce Permitting and Licensing Process to have business and entrepreneurs up and running fast. 

I will create a Business one-stop website that lists all Business documents including Guidelines for all countries and cities.

Once a year or every 2 years, I will arrange Global Business Summit and International Business Conferences.

REDUCING EXTRA EXPENSES AND PROTECTING HOTEL BUSINESS 

I met and spoke to approximately 80 to 90 hotel owners / entrepreneurs. After the Covid 19 Pandemic, these business owners are struggling to keep their business going. As Labor Commissioner I will support Hotel Owners. We will work together and cut $5.00 state tax. This is another plan for my first 100 days in office. Here will be a Special Committee created for this purpose. I already spoke with 6 to 7 State legislators.

What is $5.00 Extra charge ?
The $5.00 charge was passed in March 2015 as part of Georgia House Bill 170. The Hotel Occupancy Tax which charges guests an extra $5.00. per night no matter what the rate of the Hotel Room. Unfortunately, this New Tax was created in the late night with no opportunity for citizen or industry to chime in. You can see other states don't have $5.00 extra charge so why only Georgia??  All the fees and Taxes add up for guests budgeting for an extra $5.00 Per Night. 

BOUNCE BACK GEORGIA.
I understand that termination, layoffs, in some cases, set people on either path or grief or crime. My office will always be open for you. We will help you with benefits and also help in your next job search, so we can bounce back our state, together.

FORGET and FORGIVE.
Unity is the key to progress, prosperity, and peace. I was an Inmate Supervisor and often heard the inmates worry about their next meal, next job and survival. As Labor Commissioner I will make a special committee and work with Law Enforcement and Jail. I will send a motivational video and my message for every prisoner to let them know that they are human too. After their time, they will be welcome in my office to apply for benefits and provided assistance in search for a new job and a new life. This is another agenda for the first 100 days

EVERYTHING ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP SEMINARS.

I plan to hold a series of beneficial seminars for everyone.

A Free Seminar for High School and College Students 
Updated Technology, Best management practice, Training , Financing ,Encouragement ,Arrangement,, Thought Process, Technology Thinking , Productivity Thinking.
leadership Thinking. Goal Oriented talk, Direction & Decision talk., How to start up business, What is SBA LOAN and Commercial Loan What License you need and so forth. 

Mission Financial Protection Seminars.
Financial House ,Protection, Debt Management, Emergency Fund , Investment, Growth, Development, Financial Education, Safety, Security.

CUSTOMER SERVICE.
My main focus is  #1 Customer Service. As a Labor Commissioner I will hire more staff. to receive calls and emails. I will introduce a call center and we will answer calls 24/7.
I will take care of my employees, respect them, try to provide the best facilities, and treat them like family, best training updated technology. I believe Leadership Attracts Loyalty & Commitment. I will take care of my employees so they can provide friendly and generous reception service for our citizens.

AGRICULTURAL (H2A Program)
I spoke to approximately 50 to 60 Farmers. They shared their struggles with lack of 
manpower /labor shortage. As Labor Commissioner, I will create Agricultural workforce Development Program through the Technical college system of Georgia to train future farmers and Agri-Business Leaders. I will be part of the "" Georgia Grown"" campaign. I will offer international help to Georgia Farmers and Agri Business to take their products to the global market.  If farmers want more labor, then I will start an H2A Program
The H 2A Program allows U.S. employers who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs. I already spoke with some Immigration attorneys about what way we can help our Georgian Farmers.

ELECTION INTEGRITY  
If our SOS wanted extra help for Election Integrity,  I will definitely help them secure our election and legal vote counts only. I will have motivated poll watchers in the workforce.

KEEP OUR ECONOMY STRONG
My goal is Georgia GDP VS US GDP.
I will strive to ensure that Georgia has highest turnover, business expansion, largest manpower, and biggest infrastructure.

MY DREAM PROJECTS .
- Invite more investors to invest in our Great State Georgia.  
- 7 star Hotel, World's Biggest shopping mall, World's Tallest Building , Global Business HUB, IT HUB, Technology HUB, World's Best Medical college, World's best Dental College ,World's Best LAW College. Cricket Stadium
World largest Food Court.
I believe When we work together, from all levels of government and private sector, there's nothing we can't build. Our partnership makes great things happen @ Georgia and America.   

MY MESSAGE
Dear Georgians, 
Your Life matters. Your Vote matters. Your Voice matters. And your career matters too.
As A Labor Commissioner I will am ready to serve you. Are you ready? Think about this:
Hopeless END or Endless Hope
Breakdown    or Breakthrough
By Chance   or By Choice.
By Default or By Design

MY MOTTO:
ONE RACE HUMAN RACE. ONE BLOOD RED BLOOD.
AMERICA FIRST AND AMERICANAS FIRST.
GEORGIA FIRST AND GEORGIANS FIRST.

Day 358

11-30-2020 is the day I realized my personal freedoms were in serious jeopardy.

Since deciding to run for United States Senate here in Georgia that night, most Americans have willingly surrendered their personal freedoms, hoping for safety, provided by government, from a virus that poses no serious risk to most Americans. 

They told us not to wear masks.

Then they told us to wear masks. #TwoFacedLiars

They told us to lock ourselves indoors.

Then they told us to go outdoors.

They told us they didn't know anything about the virus. They said it was a new virus that definitely came from nature. They said that's why the science keeps changing. #FauciLiedPeopleDied

Now we know it definitely came from the Wuhan lab, and they have been studying it for years. They created it, so they knew everything about it. #CoronaLies

So their mask and lockdown orders were lies. They knew cloth masks and sending people indoors would help spread the virus. #FauciTheMonster

Many Americans became less healthy, intentionally, making them more susceptible to serious complications with Covid-19.

They waited for vaccines.

They said don't take the vaccines if they are distributed under Trump. #NewVaccineTechnology

They said if you don't want the vaccine, you won't have to inject it into your body.

Then they said everyone must inject the vaccine, no questions asked. Shut up and obey or they destroy your life and family. #VaccineWhip

They said it definitely didn't originate from a lab in Wuhan China. They banned all talk of the Truth.

They demanded participation in the #MaskLies. Most Americans trusted them enough to obey without question. They say ""Trust the Science"" so as to shut down all critical thought. And all the Leaders, everywhere, obeyed without question.

This is why I'm running for United States Senate in 2022. It's why I'm recruiting others to run for office. #FreedomFirst I know how this ends.

I refuse to bend a knee to Xi Jinping or Fauci. That will never happen. #CancelTheTyrants

We are running for office, across the country, at all levels, as Independents who Demand Absolute Truth.

Love,
Michael William Fackrell

The guide Living Humanism advocates in its core principles that we pursue our own well-being and the well-being of all others, as well as aiming to reduce and prevent the suffering of ourselves and others, as far as is possible. If we can achieve these goals, then that will make for an excellent 2022.

Let's hope we can deal with and overcome the challenges that 2022 will bring, that we can enjoy well-being and happiness ourselves and that we can support others to enjoy such well-being, love, happiness, fulfilment and more.

I wish you all the best for the new year.

Clinton/Slaughterhouse/Bagwell

At the closing of the Board meeting on the September 16th, mayor Bagwell you stated: “that the individual even this morning while he thinks we have no public comment – he manages to be here every meeting making public comments, so I just want to put that on the record that it just isn’t so”.
This is an outright lie.
I was the only male that addressed the Board that morning. So, the He your referencing mayor can only be me. I never stated there is no public comment.
Mayor, you said regarding public comment on agenda items: “I might be willing to consider that at a point – I have chosen not to do so – for this reason – we are under a covid restriction whether we agree with it or not - it does not matter”. 
That statement reminds me of a Bill Clinton statement – “I did not have sexual relations with that woman”.
Both statements are political BS.
Mayor, your mandate of restricting public comments on agenda items due to the covid is nothing more than a scheme to silent citizens.
We are living in a time where politicians are using covid to their advantage, and this is most certainly the case with the mayor.
The slaughterhouse agenda comes to the Board in November. Citizens will only be allowed to speak at public comment for three minutes. The slaughterhouse owners have no speaking limits. This format totally favors the owners, not the citizens. This is not the American way.

The Government is implementing new measures to try and slow down the spread of the Omicron variant. This involves the guidance to work from home where you can, extending the use of masks into most non hospitality settings, and requiring a lateral flow test to enter larger venues, with an exemption for the fully vaccinated.

While there is much still to learn about the Omicron variant, what is clear is that it spreads much more quickly than anything we have seen so far. How exactly this will translate into hospitalisations and tragically deaths is something we will come to understand in the weeks and months ahead. With infections doubling roughly every two days, we will not have long to wait.

I firmly believe that another lockdown would be devastating for our country, especially for children and young people. Schools must be kept open and education functioning as our highest priority. Many businesses have also been under incredible pressure for much of the last two years and the damage of another lockdown would push many of them over the edge.

I have spent the last few days going over this with colleagues and Ministers, carefully weighing the options available to us and how best to proceed. I have been very troubled by the notion of so-called vaccine passports. My instinct is that they are an affront to British and democratic values and the evidence seems clear that they do not work.

However, I am persuaded that what the Government has come forward with puts the focus on testing, with Covid certification as a secondary measure, allowing an exemption to testing. I will support the Prime Minister in this as there is no compulsion to use them, testing is the focus and this seems like a sensible step for high risk venues.

I would have preferred that testing was the sole element of this policy and I will be urging the Government to drop the use of Covid certification from any future policy decisions. Fortunately, these are temporary measures that will expire in January of next year, when we will have a better idea of what we are facing.

I am instinctively against further restrictions; we must learn to live with this virus. We have already felt the dreadful effects of lockdown, in lost time with loved ones, in lost education and in lost opportunity. I fear that there will be more consequences to come, as we move into dealing with the legacy of Covid-19.

So I will today support the Prime Minister who has led our country through such incredibly challenging times. My reservations and concerns persist but I have faith that Boris Johnson will lead us through the darkness as he has before, steering a course to recovery once again."

Help us end fur farming in Washington state 🚨

PLEASE TAKE 2 MINUTES and politely ask the Rural Development, Agriculture & Natural Resources Committee to support HB 1718!

Take action at www.pasadosafehaven.org/2MA (link in profile!)

HB 1718 would promote animal welfare, address serious environmental concerns, and protect public health by prohibiting the production and manufacturing of fur in Washington state.

Mink farming is a cruel, outdated process. However, more than 3 million pelts are skinned from animals each year in the U.S. And you may be surprised to know that many of those come from Washington state. Like all forms of concentrated farming, minks on farms are deprived of the ability to engage in any natural behaviors. These naturally wild animals are confined to tiny cages before they are killed by anal or oral electrocution, neck breaking or suffocation. In addition to this suffering, it has been discovered that in these concentrated conditions, minks can harbor COVID-19, including mutated versions of the virus, which has the potential to contribute to a new pandemic wave.

Thank you to our partner advocates at Animal Rights Initiative and The Humane Society of the United States - Washington

neighbors in Anne Arundel County lost their lives last week to COVID-19. That’s an average of three per day. They are not numbers, they are human beings with families and friends. We are projected to continue losing our people at that rate or higher in the coming weeks.

I had hoped we were done with government mandates in our COVID response, but science is clear that masks slow the spread of this virus. Masks keep kids in school, workers on the job, people out of hospitals, and people alive. They don’t save everyone, but they do save some.

Our hospital leaders pleaded with the County Council to extend the mask mandate, citing studies that show more people mask when it’s required. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLPcSB266AM&t=1s

Of the 540 local businesses that responded to our recent questionnaire, nearly two-thirds said that they support a government mask mandate. They want to protect their employees and the economy that sustains them.

Of the 1752 county residents that sent testimony to our County Council for last Friday’s special session, 75% supported extension of our mask mandate.

All of our neighboring counties have implemented temporary mask mandates to address this super-surge, and the Governor is once again saying, “Wear the damn mask.”

So what the hell is going on with the Anne Arundel County Republican Party? All three of its representatives on the seven-member County Council voted Friday to end our county’s mask mandate, the day after their party sent an anti-mask fundraising appeal. 

On November 15th, the same three council members voted against accepting $5.4 million in desperately needed state grants to continue our Health Department’s COVID vaccination program, testing, and opioid intervention work.

It’s a strange development. The Baltimore County Council also has a seven-person council with three Republicans on it, and they put together a 6-person supermajority in favor of a mask mandate. Republican-led counties across the state are eagerly accepting state grants to combat this virus.

I’m often told by keyboard activists from the far right that my commitment to slow the spread of this virus in our county will cost me the next election, a risk I take willingly. The unfortunate reality, however, is that it’s not just an online fringe that is challenging the longstanding consensus that public health and public safety are a fundamental obligation of government. It’s also the party leadership, and even the candidates who are running campaigns to put themselves in this job.

Herb McMillan uses this newspaper as his vehicle to weave circular logic about COVID that would likely be banned by Twitter and Facebook, and the political machine behind Jessica Haire uses expensive television ads during Fox News. 

The Haire campaign, chaired by her husband and transitory (2004) candidate for County Executive Dirk Haire, went so far as to run television ads in recent weeks suggesting that business closures early in the pandemic, the ones that were mandated by Governor Hogan, were a failure of leadership. 

I won’t shrink away from the debate over the obligation of government to protect its people, the longstanding bi-partisan American tradition of government-driven vaccination programs and health orders, and even the specifics of every difficult decision that I, the Governor, and my peers in neighboring counties have made during this pandemic in consultation with our health officers.  

This county’s Republican Party used to represent fiscal conservatism and a healthy disdain for excessive regulation. It has recently become so ferociously opposed to delivering the basic functions of local government that its leaders are no longer capable of managing the public institutions that they malign.

So as we enter this election year, we must show passion in defense of our local public servants and the work that they do on behalf of our residents. We must show the contrasts between the progress we are making and efforts to undermine that progress. 

And we must never back down in defense of our right to protect the health and safety of our beloved neighbors."

Primary defeats to established figures and shock results in referendums are becoming the norm, while ‘outsiders’ are shaking up political cultures. In this book, Ali Milani, a rising star in the UK’s Labour Party, brings a unique perspective on the key political issues we are now facing in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to show how young people from different backgrounds can engage in politics.

Using his rollercoaster campaign against Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the UK’s 2019 general election and his time in Bernie Sanders’ campaign team, he inspires a new generation of political leaders from the disenfranchised, disillusioned and marginalised to usher in a new wave of diverse voices and experience in mainstream politics."

I have contacted the governor’s office multiple times only to be told that there is nothing the governor can do.

I tried to run an amendment on HB1001 last week. My amendment would have given complete protection for Hoosiers by making it illegal for anybody to impose/enforce a vaccination upon another person. 

My amendment was called out of order by Representative Dan Leonard and I was told that it was not germane to the bill and that it was bill pending. The establishment released HB 1408 that same morning and I had drafted my amendment 4 days prior to the release of HB1408; they were saying that I used language from a bill that I did not even know existed at the drafting of my amendment and thus, they used one of the House rules to call me out of order. How does one draft an amendment from a bill that doesn’t exist? Answer, they can’t! That is utterly absurd!!

My amendment absolutely had everything to do with HB1001! Representative Dan Leonard who argued with me behind the scenes, off camera, explaining why my amendment was not germane; I explained to him this was a constitutional issue on bodily integrity/autonomy and had EVERYTHING to do with HB1001. 

Representative Leonard just looked at me like I had lost my mind. I could only assume Representative Leonard’s disdain was because I brought the Constitution into the conversation. I then asked Speaker Todd Huston to call down Chairman Representative Heath VanNatter who was the chairman over HB 1408 to get a commitment from him to get a hearing and a vote on HB1408 and to be able to announce publicly from the podium that I would withdraw my amendment if I could get the commitment from chairman VanNatter for the hearing and vote. 

Speaker Huston just looked at me disgusted, very visibly annoyed, and said repetitively and very emphatically to me, ‘No!!  No!!’ HB1408 would have put a ban on COVID-19 vaccinations. But the sad reality is that the establishment did not want to go on record for truly protecting Hoosiers! How disgusting!"

Also, is there anything missing in this equation that the media or the Biden Administration is not taking into consideration?

In 2020 the U.S. consumed nearly 20 Million Barrels a day, which has only been increasing in 2021 as Covid restrictions have been loosened and Americans are traveling more.

So this release of Oil from the Strategic Reserve is less than 3 days with of oil consumption by consumers in the United States. This has been pointed out by many saying that this small supply of oil will have little effect on prices at the pump.

What is missing is that the U.S. will be selling oil at a wholesale price of approximately $80 per Barrel. This comes to $4 Trillion into the Government’s Coffers. So it’s not a bad time to release this oil that is sitting idle while our Government continues to run a deficit, 

Ideally, when the Biden Administration replenishes the oil that is sold into the market, the price will be lower than when the U.S. Government buys it back. And if they plan their purchases properly, just as a prudent investor in the stock market would, they would not buy it all at once but in little pieces so as not to drive up the price.

BIPOC communities and leaders are always impacted and blamed by the dominant culture when the chips are down. The chips have definitely been down in this extraordinarily difficult two years of COVID and palpable, surfacing wounds of racial trauma. It’s no wonder that BIPOC leaders such as Alison Collins, Faauuga Moliga, and Board President Gabriela López are taking heat.

The lows..... This wretched virus and seeing so many loved ones getting Covid. Plus, my dad struggling with his health for the first time ever. I really believe 2022 is going to be an amazing year.....so amazing that we will forget all the struggles of 2021.

🤱🏾It is observed to help more people learn about the urgency of the country's maternal mortality crisis and how we can work together to reverse its course.

✔️Racial disparities in maternal health do exist, even after accounting for confounding factors. 

✔️The U.S. is the only developed country in the world with a rising maternal mortality rate. 
🤱🏽Approximately 60% of maternal deaths are preventable.
🤱🏻Racial inequities contribute to that disparity: Black patients die during and after pregnancy at a rate three times higher than white patients, and those who are American Indian and Alaska Native die at a rate two times higher than white patients. 

✔️The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to recent maternal mortality rates, as the virus is associated with increased risk of severe complications—including death—during pregnancy.

✔️We have the data, so what do we do now?
 
✔️The following are essential:
🤱educate the obstetrical provider AND the patient
🤱🏼improve access to maternity care benefits (ie expansion of Medicaid)
🤱🏾standardize data collection related to maternal morbidity and mortality
🤱🏿establish maternal mortality review committees
🤱🏽establish perinatal quality collaboratives
🤱🏻require reporting of data stratified by race and ethnicity
🤱participate in the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program 
 •AIM is a national data-driven maternal safety and quality improvement initiative. 
 •Based on proven safety and quality implementation strategies, AIM works to reduce preventable maternal mortality and severe morbidity across the United States.
🤱🏼extend focus to preconception, pregnancy and perinatal care, as well as extend postpartum care and coverage up to a year

Let me understand this…the CDC is now moving the goal posts for quarantine duration?!

I have no issue whatsoever getting people back to work sooner than later…..none. I agree at this point we have little choice considering the circumstances.

Some of the wounds we have suffered are unavoidable and others are the worst kind….self-inflicted wounds.

Because of FAKE news and lousy handing of this pandemic from day 1 we are where we are today!

All the wrong people have been at the podium and the CDC has become a political organization. Full stop.

I also understand the need for a “balanced” approach and dealing with a crisis of epic proportions.

However, DO NOT tout science when you are making NON-scientific decisions in order to try and balance the reality of what is needed at this time in the real world.

MILLIONS of people CHOSE their personal “freedoms” over being a patriotic American and doing the right thing. We now have 85% of people currently in hospitalized with COVID are the UNVACCINATED and OVERWHELMING the healthcare system, costing the taxpayers billions with a B in $$$.

All the while a FREE and readily available vaccine was and is available to prevent this calamity! 

LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. A FREE AND READILY AVAILABLE VACCINE WAS AND IS AVAILABLE TO PREVENT THIS CALAMITY!

Yes, I am not ignorant enough to not admit that occasionally a person vaccinated will unfortunately get admitted to the hospital with COVID despite their best efforts. Yes that is a thing. Nothing is full proof.

With that being said, what do we mean when we say overwhelm the healthcare system ….what does that look like?

It means the doctors, nurses, cleaning people, transport crews, greeters, EMTs, nursing aides, cooks, lab technicians and on and on cannot sustain this tragedy at the level of response needed to take care of people !!

Don’t worry at all about hospital administration which includes now doctors and nurses now because they ran for the hills and were the first ones in line for a vaccine under the tent. They even got their friends and families vaccinated before it was even available to the public at large. They’ll be just fine. Why? Because they are thieves of the worst kind.

So what systems have to deal with is not only COVID patients but the run through traffic that walks through our ERs every single day.

Especially this time of year.

People who have heart attacks, strokes, kidney or heart failure, cancer related issues, trauma and so on!

What do you think? There are endless hospitals that go 24/7... 365 at your call in a good year that are just waiting open arms to care for an additional hundreds or thousands of patients in a moments notice?

WHERE do you put those sick people when there is no where to put them and NO ONE to truly care for them?

Don’t think for one second that during wave 1 people in hospitals didn’t die of unintended neglect because they did.

We barely had PPE let alone a room reservation!

So, since we need to get healthcare teams back working again ASAP to take care of the country in their times of most need ….SCREW THEM again. Come on back early.

Let’s overwork, under pay the people who SELFLESSLY put themselves in HARMS way every single day to care for other citizens in our UN-Unified country. No problem come on back in “essential” workers. 

Nurses already had nursing to patient ratios that were ridiculous to begin because hospitals are cheap to pay for more nurses. They would rather ensure their salaries and make cuts to the true essentials in ""essential workers. WHO do you think is really caring for patient during this pandemic??  Thats right NURSES. 

Arguably the backbone and the glue that holds hospital units together all day everyday. 

But hey you’re not infectious anymore. Why? Because we say so! 

Maybe not infectious but maybe so.

That’s what I want…an overworked recently sick amazing ICU nurse that may be shedding virus taking care of my mother in the ICU when she is deathly sick with something other than COVID only to contract COVID? Really??? Is that where we are? . Guess we are so desperate we have no choice?

And you know what! We do it. We will do it . Because we have a conscience. We have a heart. We have love for those that we don’t know and have never met because we love what we do and because we believe in a purpose greater than ourselves.

So IF we can. We will be there for YOU AMERICA.

So back to the science. Honestly though based on what?? Everyone speaks to science. They are speaking antiquated science at best. To me it’s all smoke and mirrors.

What data regarding OMICRON is currently available to guide this reduced quarantine time ??? What? What we know about Omicron is that it is the most contagious strain we have seen this far. So contagious that it wiped out Delta in a matter of WEEKS to take the number 1 spot on the list!

This new goal post shift is based on data from prior strains of COVID not OMICRON!!!

This is unacceptable. In my neighborhood it’s called BS.

Just be forthright and truthful.

It’s really that simple. We can handle the truth because we already know what and why you are doing it!

Even the biggest advocates of vaccinations, masking, distancing etc will begin to turn on you!

Get a spine.

Here’s the truth. Most testing is nonsense. The rapid test is a waste of time. Too early you’ll miss it.

3 days later repeat it or get a PCR and it’s positive.

In the meantime, you’ve infected likely tens of other people in your circle.

When people are “sick” they know.

When they aren’t they aren’t.

Yes you can be a carrier no doubt and be without symptoms.

BUT most people walking around have no idea they are and most aren’t testing themselves. So unless you are TESTING EVERYONE. It’s virtually useless.

The only role in my eyes for testing at this point is TEST to RETURN to work. That makes sense. 

The numbers of currently infected are grossly underestimated! By millions! Why ?!! Because we don’t have a testing infra-structure ...never did!

""Almost"" everyone has either had, is infected (symptoms or not) or will get infected with some form of coronavirus of the COVID variant variety.

The numbers that get posted and all the news media attention are INACCURATE AT BEST, and probably underestimate by millions of people in this country alone.

Right now we are lucky the virus is evolving into a more contagious less deadly strain (OMICRON).

However, the potential remains that a new more virulent and deadly strain can develop.

Soooooo, GO GET VACCINATED, GET BOOSTED!

Eventually just like the flu we will have some true anti-viral oral medications to treat people outside the hospital to prevent hospitalizations ! We are close. When that happens you should still get vaccinated given that these vaccines are VERY SAFE and EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE against different strains, clearly not all at this point.

Honestly, if you are unvaccinated and get sick requiring hospitalization that’s on you! 

Your body, your choice, your freedom.

NO PROBLEM! It’s AMERICA after-all! 

I can do whatever I want when I want right?! 

NOT. I can give you a hundred examples where that doesn’t apply and you comply without question. So spare the rhetoric. It’s also called BS.

If you are unvaccinated and get COVID then please stay the hell out of the hospital and be a grown up.

We teach our children this all the time. Actions have consequences! Don’t they?

You don’t trust the medical community enough to take a simple vaccine why the hell do you trust me then with your life when you get sick!? What changes? Now you realize your potential for mortality? Save me, save me? Sorry shouldn’t work that way.

Live with your freedom and accept your choice.

Don’t endanger me, my team and my family that behaved like responsible adults and did the right thing.

Unless you want a “hand” out. Literally.

LIVE FREE DIE HARD.

The logistics have actually been pretty easy and customers have been cheerful and almost all appreciative.  Thanks!  But the reality is there haven’t been very many of you here.  It’s been very cold and January is always a slow month so may or may not be because of the mandate.  We don’t know if our experience is shared by restaurants all over the city, but guessing it’s pretty likely there are many restaurants across the city right now with owners that are staring at very empty dining rooms and not sure what’s next.

At Common Roots we’ll work our way through this, and look forward to warmer, less covid-y times ahead, but the truth is the financial numbers are worse these weeks than at any point in the past couple years.  It was much harder to operate last year, but we also had very large government support programs to help us keep going and employ people.  Those programs are gone.  A small portion of restaurants got very large grants from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, but most got nothing.  We were in the nothing group.  And now we have a vaccine mandate as a new unknown.

 We support the mandate.  It’s the right thing for public safety, for helping to try to keep our customers safe and our hospitals and medical staff from being even more excessively over strained.  But it’s also a big unknown for restaurants — will less people show up?   Is this one more thing that suppresses sales even more, and asks more of our staff in an already bad time?  Or maybe this will actually make more people feel safe dining out?

We don’t know the answer yet.  But we’re sure this would be an excellent time to buy something from your favorite restaurants.  Go out to eat if you’re comfortable doing so, order to-go or delivery if you’re still hesitant to dine out.

And for our city leaders of all kinds (elected officials, media, religious leaders, neighborhood leaders, people who have lots of friends, whatever), this would be a great time to encourage people who can afford to and feel comfortable doing so to get some great food or drink from small businesses they love and want to continue to have in their neighborhoods.  We can have a vaccine mandate AND rally support for our restaurants.

As for Common Roots, we’ve added Friday Night Family Meal boxes and Care Package deliveries which are helping keep some staff busy.  And we’ll be creatively trying to keep our minds focusing on Patio season that can’t be that far away already, right?  We’re serving up good food and drink in our cafe, private dining room, and for pickup or delivery.  Wed-Friday 9a-8p, Sat & Sun 9a-2p.

We're looking forward to the day when our hospitals aren't near full, our front line workers aren't exhausted, and we can be around people in public spaces and not be thinking about risks. We're all on our way to that place. It's just a meandering path we're all on together."

Let me be the first to say I appreciate the fact that we still have a local newspaper that covers local news.  While the AP articles are not always unbiased, I continue to support and subscribe as I have for many years.

Most of the time I feel I am quoted accurately,  however, I feel the need to clarify the verbiage of a few quotes attributed to me in a recent article.

First, I did not describe the Save Women Sports Act as “ensuring transgender women cannot participate in women’s sports.” Instead I have been consistent in stating that  BIOLOGICAL MALES should not be allowed to compete against girls and women.  

This is important to me because use of the “woke” term, “transgender women” implies that a person can actually change their sex. This is not only scientifically impossible, but, in my opinion, gives people the false belief they can do so.

Second, the article stated I supported a bill to ban critical race theory, “although critical race theory is not in the state’s school curriculum.” Unfortunately, the latter is often repeated media commentary, not my words.

CRT has been included in curriculum at USC and Clemson, in teacher training nationwide, and likely at some SC public schools, based on the numerous complaints of concerned parents. 

While the words,  “critical race theory” are not necessarily used, the tenets of the theory include the teaching that “an individual, by virtue of his race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously” and “an individual should feel guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race or sex.”  

I said to the Index that “no one should be taught to be ashamed of their race in our state,” and I stand by that statement.

Finally, I pointed out that the courts are currently dealing with federal COVID mandates and there is not a lot that a state legislature can do.  This does not mean that we have not tried to ban mandates, nor does it mean there is “[no role] for the legislature in responding to the pandemic.” In partnership with Governor McMaster, we have certainly been involved in allocating both state and federal funds on an emergency basis to mitigate the pandemic for the last two years.

Index, thank you for allowing me to clarify these quotes.  If you want to print this as my “letter to the editor,” please feel free to do so."

TONIGHT WEDNESDAY JANUARY 12, 2022
 
RICHMOND — There will be a special Town Council meeting tonight Wednesday, January 12th at 6:00pm.
 
The special council meeting will take place virtually via Zoom, in accordance with Gov. Dan McKee’s latest COVID-19 directive, on Wednesday, January 12th at 6 p.m.
 
Please use this link to attend the zoom meeting: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86551222273
 
Earlier today, the Richmond Town Hall circulated a message that the meeting was cancelled.  Then, the following message was later circulated by the town as a correction: 
“Tonight's Special Town Council meeting is NOT cancelled. It is anticipated that there will not be a quorum, however. Sorry for any confusion previous messages may have caused.”
 
The agenda can be accessed here: https://clerkshq.com/Richmond-ri?docId=jan12_22ag...
 
The agenda reads as follows:
Discussion and Consideration Regarding Soliciting Proposals for Town Solicitor for the Town of Richmond
a) Establish Qualifications/Review Criteria
b) Determine Advertisement Scope
c) Determine Potential Contract Terms
 
Background:
Karen Ellsworth’s contract expires on January 31st. She has served as the Town Solicitor since 2005. In August 2021 and again in October, Council President Nell Carpenter took action to replace Ellsworth, when she proposed that the town accept bids for solicitor for the Town Council, as well as municipal boards. Both motions were defeated, with Lauren Cacciola and Carpenter supporting the motions and Jim Palmisciano, Ron Newman and Rich Nassaney opposed.
At the January 4th council meeting, Ellsworth’s contract was on the agenda for renewal. With councilor Richard Nassaney absent, a vote on whether to renew the contract ended in a tie. Carpenter and Cacciola voted against the renewal while council Vice President Palmisciano and councilor Newman voted in favor of renewing Ellsworth's contract.
At that meeting, Palmisciano proposed, for a second time, using a standard corporate employee evaluation procedure to measure Ellsworth’s performance, and the council agreed to continue the discussion of the proposed evaluation protocol to the January 18th council meeting. However, on Friday afternoon, notice of a special council meeting was posted on the town’s website, and the only agenda item is Ellsworth’s contract.

The small print states that ""Some"" patients are no longer positive but it turns out that ""Some"" is MOST.
I can PROVE this and the local media including the Sarasota Herald tribune knows that I can, but they fail to report it.
Why is a local Hospital lying to you? Why are the local media covering up for them?
If they're lying about this,what else might they be lying about?

Over the past few months, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has faced immense criticism for breaking the rules around Covid lockdowns.

When Wales and the rest of the UK were in lockdown, with people sacrificing visiting loved ones, grieving relatives and funerals – Downing Street on 20 May 2020 invited over 100 people to a “bring your own booze” party. The alcohol-fueled party was organised just five days after another cheese-and-wine event in the same venue. These matters are now being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gary.

As the Prime Minister was breaking the rules, according to figures from the National Police Chiefs’ Council, police forces in England and Wales issued 14,244 fines for breaches of lockdown laws between March and May 2020.

66 per cent of voters – including 42 per cent of those who backed Conservatives in 2019 – recently polled by Savanta ComRes said that Boris Johnson should resign over the issue.

It is small business Saturday tomorrow 4th December, why not shop local and support all our wonderful Love Lindley local shops and businesses.

Ahead of Small Business Saturday, Lindley councillors are calling for small businesses in Kirklees to be given a tax cut, saving them thousands of pounds annually. 

Lindley Liberal Democrat councillors have backed their party’s proposals, which would benefit 7,600 small businesses and entrepreneurs in Kirklees, from cafes to high street shops. 
This figure includes 2,000 employers in the Colne Valley constituency, 1,900 in Huddersfield and also in Batley and Spen and 1,800 employers in Dewsbury. 

The tax cut proposed by the Liberal Democrat national party would save small businesses an average of £5,000 a year by aiding them with staff costs. It would be achieved by quadrupling the Employment Allowance to £16,000 for a period of two years. 
This would allow a small business to employ five people on an average salary without paying any National Insurance contributions. It is estimated that 1.1 million businesses would be eligible for this tax cut, which would save them £5.5 billion next year.

Small Business Saturday, this year on Saturday 4th December, is a grassroots, non-commercial campaign which highlights small business success and encourages customers to ‘shop local’.
It comes as a record number of small businesses say that they are struggling with rising costs, whilst new Covid-19 restrictions loom, according to a recent survey by the Federation of Small Businesses. Local restaurants have also reported a surge in Christmas bookings being cancelled, setting owners back thousands of pounds. 

Meanwhile, the Government has announced that small businesses will have to pay more National Insurance contributions in the New Year, despite facing a tough winter. 

Research by the House of Commons Library has shown that the Government’s plans are set to hit an estimated 6,000 local businesses across Kirklees with a £15.6 million tax bombshell. 
Lindley councillor, Cllr Cahal Burke, said: 

“Our local shops and restaurants are the backbone of our community and must be helped through a tough winter. Businesses in Kirklees are struggling with mounting bills and worries about the impact of the new Covid variant in the coming weeks. We need to help them now with a big and bold offer. 

“When local stores temporarily closed due to the pandemic lockdown measures, it was a reality of would life would be like if high street shops no longer existed. Our local high streets are places to shop and socialise, but also provide character and identity to our communities. If we don’t use our local shops during the Christmas period and over the next few months, we risk losing the heart of our communities. 

“It is disgraceful that local businesses, in our area, and elsewhere, are being forced to pay even more tax by the Government. We should help small businesses who have already suffered so much during the pandemic. 

“This is why I am backing calls for our local businesses to receive a tax cut.”

House Republicans have submitted a Joint House and Senate Resolution to enforce the 180-day limit on the Governor’s Executive Powers. In July, 2021, the General Assembly amended our General Laws, § 30-15-9(g), to limit many of the Governor’s core emergency powers to 180-days only. The 180-day limit may be extended by General Assembly. Rather than follow the law and approach the General Assembly to extend his Emergency powers beyond the 180-limit, on August 14, 2021, Governor McKee sought to skirt the law by declaring a “new” COVID state of emergency – ostensibly to provide himself with a new 180-day period without the required General Assembly approval."

We saw this when COVID hit in March of 2020 - our production of masks, tests, ventilators - all done overseas by China. When it comes to energy, Russia and the Middle East have had much control over our energy resources.

What kind of nation relies on other rival nations for our most valuable resources? One that is in a weak position. Energy security IS national security. 

In restoring our country, we must not be reliant on others for our energy. Under President Trump, we received 18,000 barrels of oil a day, while under Biden we are receiving over 12 times that amount! As a result, we’ve seen gas and energy prices skyrocket across the country. This is what happens when you destroy American energy independence.

Right now, we are seeing the repercussions of Biden’s failing energy policies. Nations are becoming more reliant on Russian energy, creating instability around the world. You can see this in Germany, with their reluctance to support Ukraine. Again, energy security is national security.

But most importantly, the idea that we should send our young men and women overseas to fight for the nations that refuse to send their own is insane. Why should we fight for nations that are scared to upset their energy provider? When our allies are not energy independent, that too is a national security risk for us.

So, what’s the bottom line? To keep Americans safe, we need strong national security. To have strong national security, we need strong energy security. With us and our allies relying on opposing nations for energy, we are putting Americans last, and our enemies first.

In running for Congress, becoming an energy-independent nation is something that we will continue fighting for. America does not need to fight another endless war over energy, we’ve already shed too much blood."

Over Christmas, I plan on spending as much time as possible with my family and loved ones and as little time as possible on social media. So unless there’s some sort of emergency or big announcement, I won’t be on here.

If you have any council related issues, inbox me or use Council email on cllrsgomez-aspron@sthelens.gov.uk.

You can find all the latest information and advice regarding Covid and Council at:

https://www.sthelens.gov.uk/coronavirus, 

and we've also pulled together in one place a range of relevant information for residents. The main page is here:

I’ve been a Councillor for ten years, over a quarter of my life and through three elections. I’ve never experienced anything as hard or as testing as this pandemic for what is now a second year. But like 2021, we can look back and be proud of what we’ve done to support each other.

In any crisis, whether it be following black out rules or rationing in War, or scientific advice in a pandemic, we have a moral duty to follow fact and science to protect the most vulnerable and ourselves. And the single biggest thing you can do is get vaccinated. Do it based on fact. And a love of your closest people. Not crap on Facebook.

The community of Newton-le-Willows came together in a horrible time to make our collective suffering less. And not everywhere else did that. So be proud.

Enjoy some time off if you can. Think of our NHS and Key Workers. 

And stay safe. Here’s to a light at the end of the tunnel in 2022 🥂

Not Brittany but Kamala
 
A New Year but the same rookie mistakes by Vice President Kamala Harris. In an interview with Administration-friendly MSNBC VP Harris came across as out of touch, told people to “GO Google,” lacked basic facts of the Administration’s  own program, and somehow ended up giving props to the work of the Trump Administration.
 
Last night, Harris sat down with MSNBC reporter Craig Melvin to discuss the Omicron variant and the Biden/Harris administration response. 
 
Harris started her interview by praising the work of creating the vaccines, the boosters and acknowledged that when COVID-19 first hit the United States, there was much we didn't know, but that we are in a much better position now. Without saying Trump's name, the vaccines, booster, therapeutics and the operations for those getting them approved and distributed happened under the Trump administration. That had to leave some people in the West Wing shaking their head.
 
But now, as we are about to enter the 3rd year of COVID, the Biden/Harris administration act like the Three Stooges are running the show. 
 
In the interview with Melvin, Harris can't remember how many home COVID tests they ordered and when asked about testing sites, she responds with ""do google."" She goes on to explain when you want to find a new restaurant go goggle it on how to get there. Apparently to her finding a restaurant and finding a place to get a COVID test are equal.
 
Why doesn't the Health and Human Service department have a site where people can plug in their zip code and the nearest COVID sites appear? Why doesn't Harris know that her administration told the American people that they had ordered 500 million home test kits? And ""do google"" is her answer?

The earlier win in Chesham and Amersham showed that we can win in areas that voted against Brexit.

But, this win is even more significant.  It shows we can also win in areas that voted Brexit!

The reason is clear.  It's the incompetence of the Government, the dishonesty, the sleaze and the double standards of ""one rule for us, but another the Conservatives"".  It's their sheer sense of privilege - they really believe that they're better than us; so why should they have to obey the rules?

More than ever Britain needs liberalism. Our children's education must be given a higher priority to make up for the lost years caused by Covid.  NHS staff and those who work in care homes need a better deal to recognise the hugely important role that they have performed. We need a more humane immigration policy.

and I intend standing as a candidate in the 2022 Colchester Borough Council local elections on behalf of the Conservative and Unionist Party. 

I have been a resident of Tiptree since 2016, moving here from the Kent coast and have been actively involved in the community since. I have served as a Parish Councillor since 2019, a Governor of Tiptree Heath Primary School since autumn 2021 and have also volunteered as a Blood Biker throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.

So why am I standing now and what do I stand for?
I have always been a conservative since I started my career through a Youth Training Scheme at my local steel mill in Sheerness, Kent. Conservative policies which provide equality of opportunity and reward hard work have helped me to get where I am today. Conservative policies have also provided me with a safety net when things havent gone as well.

It was only natural that I would represent the party that has supported me for all of these years.

Tiptree is my home and I love living here. Being able to walk on the heath, shop at Millins or Staines & Bright and enjoy a pint in The Ship all contribute to my enjoyment of the Village and I want to ensure that Tiptree remains a great place to live for years to come. 

The best way I can think of to do that is by representing the interests of local residents on Colchester Borough Council.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible.

Rhys

Last week, the Biden administration announced a requirement for commercial health plans to cover the cost of over-the-counter at-home COVID-19 test kits. Please note, this guidance DOES NOT apply to Medicare or Medicaid plans. For Medicare members, there is no reimbursement for over-the-counter rapid COVID test kits that they may purchase on their own.

At this time I have the following information pertaining to Aetna Medicare Advantage Plans:
Medicare Advantage plans cover all COVID-19 tests ordered by a doctor.
We will cover one self-ordered at-home test that is processed in a lab.
At-home rapid tests that are self-conducted are not covered at this time. (This will not prevent a Medicare member from accessing a ""free"" at-home rapid test that may be available in the community.)

Like my page. I will provide more information from carriers as I receive it. If you would like a review of your benefits or have questions please call me. 586-604-7632. Tammy"

I think it will be Luxon v Bridges for the top job. Mark Mitchell if neither of them want it. 
Luxon mysteriously polls on preferred PM polls despite the fact no-one has a clue what he's like as a politician. I put this down with the misguided belief many have that successful businessmen are the best equipped people to run a country. Maximising profits and cutting costs to appease your shareholders may work in commerce, but won't help you maintain hospitals, stop the poor from either starving or running riot, or giving the next generation a chance of a decent future.
Bridges has been leader before of course. He's smart but gaffe-prone, and has had his own lapses in judgement such as his infamous social media rant.

WHAT’S UP WITH COLORADO AVENUE

 

Just when it seems that things are looking up for Stuart, city government may be imperiling the progress that has been made.

 

Quality of life issues are taking a toll on civil society throughout the country. We are bombarded daily by news of wolf packs of looters in stores, increases in other property crimes and a general sense of lawlessness due to local governments forgetting its prime directive…keeping citizens safe. While Stuart and Martin County’s crime rates are low, several people have commented on the homeless taking over Colorado Avenue.

Colorado Avenue has been waiting for revitalization for a decade. The City of Stuart has spent thousands of dollars turning the avenue from a highway into a walkable city street. It has public art and has had some success with new businesses opening. It has even been christened as part of the Creek Arts District. That is all in peril now.

 

There are many causes of homelessness. Drug addiction, mental illness and the loss of affordable housing all contribute to what seems to be an intractable problem. Stuart and Martin County can’t possibly provide adequate housing or, more importantly, the counselling needed to help. That needs to come from the federal and state governments to have any meaningful impact.

 

Court decisions have not made it easy to prevent the homeless from setting up camp on public property. Yet what about Stuart’s residents’ rights to go for a walk without tripping over someone sleeping on the sidewalk. Are the benches on the avenue the private sofas for those without a home? I and others have seen men publicly urinating on Colorado.

 

Where is our Stuart PD in all of this? Again, Stuart residents and I have noticed a reduction in police presence in our city. The city wants to have people from all over patronize restaurants, stores and see the city as an arts center. That cannot happen if there is a perception of lawlessness in the very area city fathers want residents and tourists to patronize.

 

For a while, there was an officer that patrolled downtown on a Segway. I haven’t seen that since Covid. And that patrol was only on the weekends. Officers need to go back to the Segway and foot patrol downtown, in Flagler Park, and on Colorado Avenue. Citizens need to feel safe. If someone is urinating on the sidewalk, that person can be arrested. Those benches are for sitting not lounging. And the sidewalk should be free of obstructions including of the human kind.

 

At the same time, we all need to advocate for the homeless. Tallahassee and Washington need to provide adequate funding for housing that has a counseling component. But we cannot allow the few to dictate what the many can do. We tried that in the 1970s and 1980s to devastating results for civil society. We need to support the police, but the police need to be seen as doing their jobs by the public not just driving by in their cars.

Last year, the Maryland Comptroller’s Office rose to the challenge by disbursing hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID financial assistance to our citizens in record time.

Unfortunately, unacceptable delays caused by other state agencies meant that for many Marylanders, this aid simply didn’t come fast enough. The Maryland Department of Labor completely dropped the ball on keeping up with unemployment claims as citizens lost their jobs, and the Maryland Department of Education experienced significant delays in processing federal grant money for child care providers.

Failures like these have lowered public trust in the competence of state government.

The question is - Should the legislature have the authority to determine whether face masks  are required, or should that authority reside with other individuals, agencies, or departments?

And so I went ahead and wrote my living will prepared for my disposal when I was gone wrote letters to my friends and talked to my family And I just said You know it s not that big of a deal My time is over I was diagnosed with end stage terminal liver disease caused by chemicals I was exposed to while repairing boats and not taking proper safety precautions The doctors weren t optimistic My liver was deteriorating and I was in agonizing pain I visited the hospital several times a week to drain the waste my liver couldn t process and the doctors told me I would need a liver transplant to survive I had more than once begged my dad to bring me one of my pistols and one of my bullets so that I could go ahead and get it over with the pain and problems of having a terminal illness I had already taken the time to fill out a living will with a DNR so that there wouldn t be any attempts to try to bring me back or put me on life support I got so bad I was actually trying to get into a nursing home because there was just no way that I could live on my own anymore and when I got to a nursing home in November I was on compassionate care through hospice and I was not expected to live through Christmas of that year Although I was on a transplant list even if I got approved they couldn t do it then So either I was going to flat out die or I was going to get a transplant That was five years ago neither have happened Death was knocking at my door I was given about a month to live and then suddenly made a miraculous turn My liver started to regenerate Livers will do that but my doctors did not expect mine to regenerate since it was operating at about Inexplicably to my doctors my liver today is operating at about While most of my doctors won t admit it I m pretty sure I know what s behind my second lease on life I was on all these kinds of harmful narcotic painkillers and Xanax but opioids are bad for your liver because your liver has to process the trash out of your system and opiates are trash I didn t want to be on them But I had a friend who knew I was in pain and wanted to see if she could help ease my pain in the final weeks of my life She d pick me up from the nursing home we d drive somewhere smoke a little marijuana spend some time together and returned to the nursing home You remember me mentioning how I wanted to die Well smoking marijuana removed my desire to accelerate my death It helped me manage my expectations of what life is going to be like with a terminal illness It helped me not only emotionally but also medically My eyes and skin were initially yellow and sickly and that suddenly changed I was like what the hell s going on And my appetite changed so I was able to eat some of my favorite foods again Most of my doctors won t admit it but I m certain I did some research and I found out that it was possible marijuana could help regenerate liver cells So I started to use marijuana more frequently Next thing we know I m well enough that I m getting ready to move out of the nursing home and go to an assisted facility and hopefully progress from there back to living on my own completely One doctor did say he thought marijuana played a positive role and my nurse practitioner agreed as well Recently my nurse practitioner took me off all the narcotics they were giving me and she agreed that if it were not for cannabis I would not be in the position I am now The owners of my nursing home knew about my situation At first I would only smoke off campus and never inside so they didn t care But once COVID came we couldn t have visitors so I couldn t go smoke with my friend I was in pain and didn t want to take narcotics I felt my only option was to smoke inside Again the owners didn t care but they recently got new management that s tied to a larger corporate entity who does not approve The management invited me to voluntarily leave within days but the owners put that on hold to allow me to get my affairs in order Much of the staff and patients actually voted for Initiative last year legalizing medical marijuana for patients with debilitating medical conditions until the state Supreme Court struck it down When the initiative passed everybody here got excited We have residents who because of their different diseases or dementias struggle every day Lots of patients here agree that it will help ease pains fears and erratic behavior I m preparing to move out and found an assisted living facility that I ll soon transition to I m hopeful that one day I ll be able to live independently without any assistance and without fear of punishment I should not be alive I ve been given a second chance at life and I m grateful for that I personally hope medical marijuana becomes law in Mississippi so I don t have to worry about going to jail for using something that is beneficial to me If it weren t for cannabis I wouldn t be here today Joe Larkins Gulfport Mississippi

“Closing the Senior Center early on in the pandemic was not a decision that was taken lightly, but it was made to protect the lives of seniors who are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19,” Mayor Grisanti said. “This was literally a life-and-death decision. However, in recognition of the importance of Senior Center programs, the Community Services Department staff have worked to offer a wide variety of virtual and in-person, indoor and outdoor classes and activities throughout the pandemic that are COVID-19 safe to make sure our seniors have access to the activities that are so important for physical and mental health and happiness during these difficult times.”

Additional free programs include Knitting, Tech Help, Legacy Park Nature Walks, Lap Swimming and more.

Dial-A-Ride program offers rides to and from doctor appointments and grocery stores, now with a newly expanded service area.

Senior Center staff are available to assist seniors by phone Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

Today, Timber Unity Association had a board meeting to elect new directors. Our past board President Mike Pihl and past board Secretary Angelita Sanchez are moving on to be co-directors of Timber Unity PAC, our political action committee that has raised thousands of dollars to help elect Oregon candidates for office and stop bad bills like HB 2020 (Cap & Trade) in the legislature and through the initiative process.  The PAC had been formed by Andrew Miller, CEO of Stimson Lumber, to help trademark and protect this movement. He has transferred that to Mike and Angelita who have both spent the past few years making Timber Unity the powerhouse that it has become in Oregon politics. 

The PAC is an integral part of how we raise money to help elect candidates. Your contributions have been so important in helping to elect TU-Endorsed candidates across Oregon and they are having a real impact in their communities. We will be keeping that focus as original TU founders go different directions to divide up the work of this incredibly amazing movement.

Now more than ever, this next election coming gives us the opportunity to focus on getting a new Governor, and breaking the tax-raising supermajority in Salem. We also know how critical county commissioner have been in standing up to Kate Brown. We were able to elect new lawmakers like Suzanne Weber, and flipped four county commissions to supporting the natural resource industries we represent. They have been strong in standing up to Kate Brown during Covid.

The only way we can legally be influential in helping elect new leader for Oregon is to have a strong political action committee where we can raise funds and make sure they have the money they need to compete with the special interests that would shut down our jobs. 

The Association, separately of the PAC, since Covid-19, has been focused on helping our communities with disaster relief. The new board will be working to determine its new path and mission as we come out of Covid. We’re optimistic that this movement can keep growing. Our PAC’s focus on changing out who represents us in government will help us keep our eye on the ball on the political side of this movement.  It’s our roots! We came together politically to stop bad laws and get better candidates elected. It’s the PAC’s #1 goal.  We’ll look forward to hearing the goals of the new Association board for how it seeks to move the member-side of the mission forward once they’ve had a chance to work that out.

A sincere thank you to all outgoing board members:

Mike Pihl, Past President
Adam Lardy, Co-Vice President, Oregon
Todd Stoffel, Acting President, and Co-Vice President, Washington
Angelita Sanchez, Past Secretary
Lindsay Berschauer, Past Treasurer
Shelly Gedenberg-Solum, Past Treasurer

And a sincere congratulations to the new board:
Jeff Leavy
Tasha Webb
Lisa Holcomb
Les Poole
Joe Stinnett
Dana Mills
Jen Hamaker
John Gilbert
Donald Jamison 

And now, it’s time to row the boat together and STAND UP and take back Oregon in 2022.

Thank you all who have supported the PAC and our Townhall Tuesdays and worked hard for candidates. And thank you to those who’ve joined the association as members.  Both entities of Timber Unity’s movement are vital to moving Oregon forward."

The U. S. equity market finished the year on a strong note as the S&P 500 Index gained 4.5% in December.  Defensive issues led the way as concerns and uncertainty regarding the Omicron variant caused investors to consider a possible slowing of economic activity. Consumer Staples (+10.3%), Real Estate (+10.2%), and Health Care (+9.0%) were the leading sectors while Consumer Discretionary (-0.3%) was the worst-performing sector.    Large and mid-cap stocks outperformed small-caps and value outperformed growth across all market–cap ranges.    
 
The Omicron variant is spreading rapidly, leading to spiking case counts, but very low fatalities.  The South African experience suggests it should flame out quickly.  Widespread lockdowns are unlikely, however consumer caution will likely temper growth and extend supply chain disruptions similar to Delta.  The economy has strong momentum and should be able to absorb another Covid slowdown. Persistent red-hot inflation, a function of too much demand (extraordinary monetary + fiscal stimulus) and too little supply (Covid impact), has forced the Federal Reserve’s (“Fed”) hand to an accelerated taper of bond purchases and three possible rate hikes in 2022.  While monetary policy remains highly accommodative, the Fed pivot to fighting inflation is not risk-friendly.  Positive growth drivers in 2022 include: (a) global reopening, (b) housing and auto rebound, and (c) inventory replenishment. In addition, the US consumer remains in great shape and in a position to power the economy forward as confidence recovers.  S&P earnings estimates have continued to move higher boosted by strong nominal growth, pricing power, and productivity gains; however, 4Q21/1Q22 estimates could get revised lower in the near term due to Omicron.
 
We continue to believe a balance of high-quality cyclical and secular growth stocks is appropriate at this time given the many uncertainties related to Covid, fiscal and monetary policy, and bond yields.  We remain highly convicted in those stocks whose positions were strengthened as a result of this pandemic and are therefore poised to perform well as the economy fully reopens and returns to a more normal state.  These stocks remain reasonably priced and are expected to deliver above-average profit growth in the year ahead.

First responders are facing several novel challenges in the field, including appropriate funding to confront modern emergencies. I appreciate the support on this bill from multiple local jurisdictions and EMS/First Responder advocacy groups.  This bill does a few things.

First, it gradually increases the medicaid emergency service transport reimbursement rate from the current $100 rate by $25 each year until it reaches $300. This gradual increase will ensure EMS are being properly reimbursed to maintain financial solvency for services rendered, while allowing the State to appropriately account for this increase (MDH has indicated they can handle this gradual increase with existing resources and revenues).

Secondly, this bill allows the reimbursement to be dispersed for ""treat not transport"", or TNT. This practice is especially prevalent for drug overdoses and similar emergencies where for whatever reason, the patient may not be transported to a hospital.  This will also have some additional unseen savings in situations where an emergency transport would be able to treat a medical issue on-site rather than face an incentive to take a patient to an ER to collect the above mentioned reimbursement, and further utilize ER resources and space.

Thirdly, we are considering an amendment to include telehealth services in this bill.  I considered the issue a couple years ago, but it was still considered a fairly novel concept at the time.  However, since COVID, including telehealth in this area of policy has much broader support to include in the bill this year.  This will also help to offset some of the cost increases by enabling on-site treatment (as mentioned above) to incorporate telehealth.

It's time for effective Covid countermeasures to be put in place by SC Gov. Henry McMaster.

Through the support of Swiss Solidarity, Medair and Aidonic partnered up to field-test the AIDONIC platform to deliver evidence and learning for the whole humanitarian community, including aid recipients about blockchain and tokenization.

#Humanitarian #aid is facing an uncertain future. Disasters and conflicts are facing increased competition from Covid-19 and climate change for funding. Digital transformation is creating needs for data security, portability, and interoperability, while social media is raising public expectations regarding transparency and efficiency.

Both Medair and AIDONIC recognize that the way aid is delivered needs to be transformed. This innovative partnership is a first step in proving novel solutions to aid delivery in the health, emergency relief, and development sectors.

AIDONIC is a unique application of blockchain and tokenization that links fundraising and aid delivery within the same platform. Through the platform, Medair aims to enhance trust, by providing donors with greater transparency, while reaching more beneficiaries by lowering the cost of transactions.

On Monday 1/17, communities across the country will gather to mark MLK Day and to demand our elected officials pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, without letting outdated Senate loopholes get in the way.

We need to send a message to our leaders: no celebration without legislation. Join us for a day of action voting rights, as we honor Dr. King with action.

This is an outdoor event, so please dress accordingly Minnesotans! Wear your masks and maintain spacing to prevent COVID spread. Please do not attend in-person if you are feeling ill. We will have a Zoom option (with captioning) for those unable to be there in person.

Among Garland residents who have died from Covid (not just “with” Covid) since Feb 2021 when 2nd dose vaccinations first became possible, only 8% were vaccinated. A full 92% of the Covid fatalities in Garland since then have been  unvaccinated residents. Parkland reported earlier this week that 95.7% of their recent Covid deaths have been unvaccinated. 

I’ve lost several unvaccinated friends whom I loved and respected—the most recent on New Years Day. They had largely judged by the experiences of their friends, many of whom had contracted Covid and been okay. Unfortunately they failed to understand that Covid hits different people in different ways. 

They gambled and lost. The tragedy is that they didn’t understand that they were playing a form of Russian Roulette with an unpredictable virus. 

The fatality stats are what they are. They aren’t imaginary numbers being manipulated by political players; they are right here in our own neighborhoods, with names and faces and families. 

I’ve shared here before that I’m a devotee of natural remedies and organic living. I make my own all-natural cleaning supplies and use organic products to keep chemicals out of my house (and body).  But I chose to get vaccinated, and recently boosted, against Covid because the risk factor was overwhelmingly obvious. 

With the onset of Omicron, the argument about “doing it for society” has become less powerful… and “eradicating” Covid has also become less likely. There’s a lot more talk about Covid eventually shifting from pandemic to endemic. 

But here’s the stark reality: people are still dying from Covid, and most of those dying are unvaccinated. And in case anyone wants to compare this to “just another flu”, you should know that the worst flu season in recent years (2016/2017) killed 80 people in all of Dallas County. Eighty. Covid shot past that number in the first 6-8 weeks of arriving in Dallas County.

I’ll make one last comment. The Covid deaths have been appalling, but it doesn’t stop there. Many people who survived Covid, including those who never had to be hospitalized, continue to deal with what’s being termed “long Covid”. I know two people personally who have been essentially crippled by the long term effects of the disease—and they both caught Covid in 2020 prior to a vaccine being available. Brain fog, crushing fatigue, etc. One, a top nurse administrator in a large hospital, had to leave the job and career she loved because she can no longer mentally function at that level. The other is living in fear of being fired because he’s not performing. He can’t. He falls asleep anytime he sits down, even to eat lunch.  

I know nothing I’ve shared will convince those who’ve chosen to believe otherwise. So be it. I respect people’s rights to make hard choices—but hopefully based on accurate information."

verse study in Corinthians on spiritual gifts The worship band really rocked it today Hey what s for lunch Zzzzzzzz My family and I spent much of visiting churches of all sizes looking for a new home church we moved to Arizona in Most of the church websites I looked at said Come as you are We didn t hear You can t stay as you are or about the narrow road that leads to life that few find Mathew They want everyone to feel comfortable which is a part of the problem I m not talking about chairs The pastor of one church we visited apologized for giving a message on depression because it wasn t a pleasant topic Another church played secular music immediately after their service The pastor at another church based his sermons on The Chosen and was encouraging the flock to watch that week s episode No wonder people are walking away from the faith churches like this are just another entertainment option I had hoped to find a church that spent time praying Sunday mornings Forget it Gonna have to start a home church if I want that Whatever happened to being devoted to teaching fellowship and prayer Acts confronting the church over its sexual sin as Jesus told us to do in Revelations and challenging people to go all out with God Maybe watching The Chosen will give me the answers I m not knocking the program but we have to discern between Cultural Christianity Christian entertainment and actually doing what has impact and is commanded in Scripture Or maybe I ll leave the TV off and go rogue by spending at least an hour every day in prayer cultivate a passionate love relationship with the Lord and focus on doing what God s word says to do instead of merely studying it Our team at Blazing Grace will continue to expose the sexual sin in the church and offer healing and freedom for those who want it And I ll focus on making my brief life count for eternity and encourage others to do the same Later this month my next book will be released The Way of the Rogue Christian Living a Life that Counts for Eternity The book will challenge and equip you and your church to live a life of spiritual impact and significance More on the book in the weeks ahead will be the year of the Rogue Christian We live in dark times that are getting darker Lukewarm believers will either fade away or they ll keep playing church as long as they don t get offended or forced out of their comfort bubble Then they ll look for another entertainment option oops I mean church Those who aren t playing games with sin or God are the ones who will be tough enough to endure to the end no matter what happens It is the Rogue Christians the doers of the word who are willing to go all the way with God who will make their lives count for eternity And then many will fall away and betray

Misogyny and sexism is deeply rooted throughout society we need to organise with each other, at schools and universities , in workplaces and in trade unions for real systemic change.

Across the UK and over the world domestic violence has been the ‘shadow pandemic’ to Covid-19. In January alone 3 women in abusive relationships were murdered over one weekend in Merseyside. Its’s estimated in the UK that 2 women a week are killed by a current or former partner. In an economic system where wages are low and welfare is underfunded women and those in abusive relationships essentially become trapped lacking the means to escape and live independently.

97 per cent of women say they have experienced sexual harassment. A lot of this happens on the street in the form of public street harassment- instead of this taken as a serious violation of women’s safety women are victim blamed with more importance placed on where they were or what they were wearing rather than why this type of harassment happens and how to end it. On top of this hate crimes towards LGBTQ+ people have quadrupled in 5 years, in the month of June there were 3 separate incidents of hate crimes towards the LGBTQ+community in Liverpool.

And now as students return to the city and nightlife venues return to a level of normality not seen in over a year, alarmingly there has been rise in drink spiking including spiking by injections. Students across the country have organised boycotts against night clubs unless their safety can be assured.

In the face of all this violence the justice system is not fit to protect women. Convictions for rape have continually dropped over the last 5 years, in 2020 only 1.6 per cent of cases lead to charges. The police cannot be trusted to keep people safe as they often commit violence towards women, LGBTQ+ and people of colour. Sarah Everard’s murder by serving Met Police officer exposed that there are not just bad apples- the whole orchard is rotten! 

The police have put pressure on organisers of 2 previous demonstrations which resulted in their cancellation- a demonstration against the rise in spiking and an event to mark the International Day Against VAWG- taking advantage of the fear caused by the explosion outside the Women’s Hospital and trying to deter women at this time from coming together. Merseyside Socialist Alternative oppose this, we say we are stronger when we come out together to stand up against misogyny and oppression in all its forms!

Join us to demand real, systemic and socialist change!"

Supreme Court Blocks COVID-19 Vaccine-or-Test Mandate for Workers at Large Companies, Allows Vaccine Mandate for Healthcare Workers

“These rulings reinforce the haphazard state of affairs right now when it comes to these COVID-19 vaccine mandates,” said constitutional attorney John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute and author of Battlefield America: The War on the American People. “At a time when COVID-19 cases are surging even among the vaccinated, causing the efficacy of the vaccines and boosters to be called into question, the government and private employers need to reconsider the heavy-handed nature of these mandates, which violate every constitutional safeguard for privacy, bodily integrity and religious freedom.”

The staggering number is almost certainly an undercount, experts say.

Also Wednesday, the California Peace Coalition — a group of parents whose kids are addicted to or have died from fentanyl or other illicit drugs — held a die-in protest in the Tenderloin, calling on the state and San Francisco to shut down open-air drug markets, prosecute dealers, and place their kids in mandatory treatment.

About Dumpstaphunk:

Dumpstaphunk stands out amongst New Orleans' best, cementing themselves as one of the funkiest bands to ever arise from the Crescent City. Born on the Jazz & Heritage Festival stage, and descended from Neville and Meters family bloodlines, these soldiers of funk ignite a deep, gritty groove that dares listeners not to move. Their performances combine ingenious musicianship through complex funk, rock, and jazz arrangements accompanied by soulful melodies and Big Easy traditions.

The band just released their 4th studio album Where Do We Go From Here on April 23, 2021 featuring Marcus King, Trombone Shorty and Chali 2Na, and is now available on double bronze vinyl, CD and all digital platforms. 

Dumpstaphunk culled material from many different sources over the past few years, creating during downtime and rare off tour cycle stop-gaps at various studios in New Orleans: some songs were born on-the-spot in the studio, others as a drum beat or a groove at sound-check. A few were simply covers that were already in the band’s live repertoire. The songwriting was largely collaborative, with all band-members contributing their own respective stylistic nuances.

For the past 17 years, Dumpstaphunk has earned its reputation as the most well-regarded next-generation New Orleans live powerhouse, the type of band whose live shows attract sit-ins from legends like Carlos Santana, Bob Weir and Trombone Shorty. Alongside Hall, Daniels, Alex Wasily, Ryan Nyther and drummer Deven Trusclair, cousins Ivan and Ian Neville have built upon their family’s iconic NOLA legacy as they’ve transformed Dumpstaphunk into the city’s pre-eminent 21st-century funk-fusion export, resulting in recent career highlights like their July 2019 opening gig for the Rolling Stones on their home turf at the Superdome.

Dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville's funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly & the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material.

Dumpstaphunk has performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival every year since 2001 and continues to tour all over the world. Most recently, before the pandemic the band supported The Rolling Stones in New Orleans, as well as toured with George Clinton & The Parliament Funkadelic for his farewell tour. They have performed on hundreds of festival stages likeJamCruise, Dead & Company’s Playing in the Sand, Lockn Festival, NYC’s Summerstage, and Byron Bay Bluesfest, and you never know who may appear as a guest on stage with the band on any given night. Guest appearances have included Santana, Bob Weir, John Oates, Lucas Nelson, Deen Ween, Blackbyrd McKnight, Jerry Harrison, Marcus King and Nicki Bluhm.

The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed our relationship to work. I have been in the classroom throughout the pandemic, and I have seen the burnout, the anxiety, the fear on display during otherwise daily tasks.

It is no secret our teachers and school employees have always been overworked and underpaid. But the pandemic has forced us to ask ourselves: If we truly believe our schools are educating the leaders of tomorrow, then what kind of work are we demanding from our educators?

It is much more than hard work. It is nearly impossible work given the system we are working in. I am running for the State Board of Education to change that system so it can work better for all students, families, and school employees.

Our work should not be deadly, and that means re-opening schools safely with extensive input from staff on implementing precautions for a safe working environment. 

Our work should be healthy, and that means having access to mental health resources and counselors on campus.

Our work should be meaningful, and that means moving away from high-stakes STAAR testing and toward teaching important subjects like service learning, digital literacy, computer science, and ethnic studies.

I believe the true work on the State Board of Education will begin when the pandemic ends, and we will need a new leader with new solutions for the problems we will face in this new world. I am ready to work hard for you."

The Governor thinks eliminating the requirement that school librarians have a master’s degree will somehow improve education in her state.

Even as COVID still rages, her strategy is to make it harder for students to get access to professional, high-quality educators like their Teacher Librarians.

Guided by Astronomer Royal, Lord Martin Rees, we’re discovering what scientific marvels and existential risks await our not-too-distant future. Whether you’re big into biotech, riveted by robotics, or concerned by climate change, there will be something to grab your attention as we time-travel to 2050 and beyond!

Thu 16 Dec 7:30pm Tickets 🎟 £4-7

Event details:

Our Earth has existed for 45 million centuries, but this is the first time that just one species – ours – has the planet’s future in its hands. And Covid 19 is a wake-up call, reminding us how vulnerable our interconnected global civilisation is. 

Advances in biotechnology, robotics, and artificial intelligence–if pursued and applied wisely–could empower us to boost the developing and developed world and overcome the threats humanity faces. But we must avoid dystopian risks. These are of two kinds. First, those stemming from our ever-heavier collective ‘footprint’ on the Earth – global warming and biodiversity loss. 

Second, those triggered by technologies so powerful that even small groups, by error or design, can create a catastrophe that cascades globally. At the same time, further advances in space science will allow humans to explore the solar system and beyond with robots and AI. But there is no “Planet B” if we do not care for our home planet.
