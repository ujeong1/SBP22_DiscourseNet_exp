As the Covid pandemic unfolded pro and anti lockdown camps aligned with preexisting political sides The Right generally favors less restrictions and a quicker return to normal while the Left urges more caution while advocating socioeconomic overhaul Many reasons explain the division the pro commerce stance and individualistic ethic on the right the desire to introduce more welfare measures and the emphasis on collective action on the left but the role of religion has been overlooked While Christianity tends to be a stronger force on the right an often unwitting Christianity helped shape the Left s attitude toward Covid

Soooooo Let me understand this the CDC is now moving the goal posts for quarantine duration I have no issue whatsoever getting people back to work sooner than later none I agree at this point we have little choice considering the circumstances Some of the wounds we have suffered are unavoidable and others are the worst kind self inflicted wounds Because of FAKE news and lousy handing of this pandemic from day we are where we are today All the wrong people have been at the podium and the CDC has become a political organization Full stop I also understand the need for a balanced approach and dealing with a crisis of epic proportions However DO NOT tout science when you are making NON scientific decisions in order to try and balance the reality of what is needed at this time in the real world MILLIONS of people CHOSE their personal freedoms over being a patriotic American and doing the right thing We now have of people currently in hospitalized with COVID are the UNVACCINATED and OVERWHELMING the healthcare system costing the taxpayers billions with a B in All the while a FREE and readily available vaccine was and is available to prevent this calamity LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN A FREE AND READILY AVAILABLE VACCINE WAS AND IS AVAILABLE TO PREVENT THIS CALAMITY Yes I am not ignorant enough to not admit that occasionally a person vaccinated will unfortunately get admitted to the hospital with COVID despite their best efforts Yes that is a thing Nothing is full proof With that being said what do we mean when we say overwhelm the healthcare system what does that look like It means the doctors nurses cleaning people transport crews greeters EMTs nursing aides cooks lab technicians and on and on cannot sustain this tragedy at the level of response needed to take care of people Don t worry at all about hospital administration which includes now doctors and nurses now because they ran for the hills and were the first ones in line for a vaccine under the tent They even got their friends and families vaccinated before it was even available to the public at large They ll be just fine Why Because they are thieves of the worst kind So what systems have to deal with is not only COVID patients but the run through traffic that walks through our ERs every single day Especially this time of year People who have heart attacks strokes kidney or heart failure cancer related issues trauma and so on What do you think There are endless hospitals that go at your call in a good year that are just waiting open arms to care for an additional hundreds or thousands of patients in a moments notice WHERE do you put those sick people when there is no where to put them and NO ONE to truly care for them Don t think for one second that during wave people in hospitals didn t die of unintended neglect because they did We barely had PPE let alone a room reservation So since we need to get healthcare teams back working again ASAP to take care of the country in their times of most need SCREW THEM again Come on back early Let s overwork under pay the people who SELFLESSLY put themselves in HARMS way every single day to care for other citizens in our UN Unified country No problem come on back in essential workers Nurses already had nursing to patient ratios that were ridiculous to begin because hospitals are cheap to pay for more nurses They would rather ensure their salaries and make cuts to the true essentials in essential workers WHO do you think is really caring for patient during this pandemic Thats right NURSES Arguably the backbone and the glue that holds hospital units together all day everyday But hey you re not infectious anymore Why Because we say so Maybe not infectious but maybe so That s what I want an overworked recently sick amazing ICU nurse that may be shedding virus taking care of my mother in the ICU when she is deathly sick with something other than COVID only to contract COVID Really Is that where we are Guess we are so desperate we have no choice And you know what We do it We will do it Because we have a conscience We have a heart We have love for those that we don t know and have never met because we love what we do and because we believe in a purpose greater than ourselves So IF we can We will be there for YOU AMERICA So back to the science Honestly though based on what Everyone speaks to science They are speaking antiquated science at best To me it s all smoke and mirrors What data regarding OMICRON is currently available to guide this reduced quarantine time What What we know about Omicron is that it is the most contagious strain we have seen this far So contagious that it wiped out Delta in a matter of WEEKS to take the number spot on the list This new goal post shift is based on data from prior strains of COVID not OMICRON This is unacceptable In my neighborhood it s called BS Just be forthright and truthful It s really that simple We can handle the truth because we already know what and why you are doing it Even the biggest advocates of vaccinations masking distancing etc will begin to turn on you Get a spine Here s the truth Most testing is nonsense The rapid test is a waste of time Too early you ll miss it days later repeat it or get a PCR and it s positive In the meantime you ve infected likely tens of other people in your circle When people are sick they know When they aren t they aren t Yes you can be a carrier no doubt and be without symptoms BUT most people walking around have no idea they are and most aren t testing themselves So unless you are TESTING EVERYONE It s virtually useless The only role in my eyes for testing at this point is TEST to RETURN to work That makes sense The numbers of currently infected are grossly underestimated By millions Why Because we don t have a testing infra structure never did Almost everyone has either had is infected symptoms or not or will get infected with some form of coronavirus of the COVID variant variety The numbers that get posted and all the news media attention are INACCURATE AT BEST and probably underestimate by millions of people in this country alone Right now we are lucky the virus is evolving into a more contagious less deadly strain OMICRON However the potential remains that a new more virulent and deadly strain can develop Soooooo GO GET VACCINATED GET BOOSTED Eventually just like the flu we will have some true anti viral oral medications to treat people outside the hospital to prevent hospitalizations We are close When that happens you should still get vaccinated given that these vaccines are VERY SAFE and EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE against different strains clearly not all at this point Honestly if you are unvaccinated and get sick requiring hospitalization that s on you Your body your choice your freedom NO PROBLEM It s AMERICA after all I can do whatever I want when I want right NOT I can give you a hundred examples where that doesn t apply and you comply without question So spare the rhetoric It s also called BS If you are unvaccinated and get COVID then please stay the hell out of the hospital and be a grown up We teach our children this all the time Actions have consequences Don t they You don t trust the medical community enough to take a simple vaccine why the hell do you trust me then with your life when you get sick What changes Now you realize your potential for mortality Save me save me Sorry shouldn t work that way Live with your freedom and accept your choice Don t endanger me my team and my family that behaved like responsible adults and did the right thing Unless you want a hand out Literally LIVE FREE DIE HARD Andrey Espinoza MD FACC FSCAI RPVI Extremely frustrated physician

life with plenty of prospects that I look forward to It is my time to give back and serve this nation and all of its citizens particularly the state of state and Georgians who welcomed me with open arms I intend to do that to the best of my ability in steering this office towards truth trust and transparency My journey in the United States had very humble beginnings I landed in USA in August of in pursuit of the American dream A month after we landed here I began working at Publix Supermarket in the Front end Department as a bagger and cart pusher In Jan of I had the opportunity to work as Cashier at Walmart Supercenter In I was blessed to get opportunity to serve at the Cobb County Department of Public Safety as an animal control officer Life took a turn when my family entered real

of Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators and Laboratory Analysts and I have been committed completely to serving the people of this peach state In I had the opportunity to be the first Indian American Honorary Driver at the US President Motorcade WHY IAM RUNNING FOR OFFICE I am a Conservative Public Servant and not a carrier politician I am running for Labor Commissioner inspired by India s philosopher and author of political treatise Arthashastra Archarya Chanakya who urged the youth to join politics instead of complaining about what is not right for the country to clean up the system

The education sector in Houston had some remarkable additions to leadership this week Yesterday I had the honor of swearing in both Kendall Baker and Bridget for the Kids as HISD Trustees after their successful reform campaigns They will both put the educational attainment of nearly k HISD students as their top priority speak out plainly about not running down CRT or other rabbit trails and stay on public policy that makes a positive difference in educating our school kids The HISD Board of Trustees has to leave the world of lawsuits and board corruption behind and start making the decision that can help close the COVID gap in education test scores Only of all HISD students are testing at grade level which means the task is enormous I believe Trustees Baker and Wade bring that view to the board and new leadership as well Also had a chance to swear in my old friend David Wilson back on to the Houston Community College Board Trustee Wilson gave an important set of remarks commenting on all the other board members backgrounds and what they can accomplish together My brief remark was that I m glad he s back on the board on behalf of all the taxpayers of Harris County To shed some insight the HCC Board has lost a couple of Trustees due to Federal law enforcement cases and they too need to leave the world of lawsuits and corruption behind and focus on student educational attainment These have been important elections for folks with conservative principles getting involved back into Houston education positions Senator Paul Bettencourt

In January of I scared many of you with an incoming Covid pandemic that would lock up the world and change our lives Now I m here to tell you that the pandemic will end in the next few weeks I don t have a crystal ball but just watch what happens in other countries Italy led our knowledge into the pandemic South Africa is telling us what will happen next Someone is South Africa got Covid and one of the coronaviruses that cause the common cold at once Both viruses invaded the same cell at the same time and their genetics got mixed up Sort of like Covid got the cold The new virus now known as Omicron has part of SARS CoV and part of the routine cold virus It became much more infectious Within weeks of Delta infections have been replaced by Omicron and in the next couple of weeks almost all Covid will be Omicron Nasty Delta will be gone This rapid shift is now happening all over the world Why is this fantastic news Omicron is like the common cold less than the flu even People get a little sick with almost no hospitalizations and no deaths and no oxygen requirements no intubations There is a slight uptick of people in hospitalized patients with Omicron but they are not there because of the virus they just happen to have the virus when tested People who have had vaccines are protected People who have had Covid are protected Both vaccinated and previously Covid positive people can still get Omicron but nobody dies gets hospitalized or requires oxygen Because this virus is infecting everyone it meets the whole world will get it within the next few weeks and before March the pandemic will be over I still recommend all people over even with no health problems or anyone under with medical conditions get your boosters In light of this information I pray that our politicians don t do anything crazy like shutting down businesses or schools and remove the vaccine mandates which hurt businesses and people who need to work and our children in school Also remove the vaccine mandate for children We will soon put this pandemic behind us and get back to glorious life Much love

I ve tried to consistently provide unpoliticized facts about Covid that rely on our local stats here in Garland rather than far away orgs with acronyms Among Garland residents who have died from Covid not just with Covid since Feb when nd dose vaccinations first became possible only were vaccinated A full of the Covid fatalities in Garland since then have been unvaccinated residents Parkland reported earlier this week that of their recent Covid deaths have been unvaccinated I ve lost several unvaccinated friends whom I loved and respected the most recent on New Years Day They had largely judged by the experiences of their friends many of whom had contracted Covid and been okay Unfortunately they failed to understand that Covid hits different people in different ways They gambled and lost The tragedy is that they didn t understand that they were playing a form of Russian Roulette with an unpredictable virus The fatality stats are what they are They aren t imaginary numbers being manipulated by political players they are right here in our own neighborhoods with names and faces and families I ve shared here before that I m a devotee of natural remedies and organic living I make my own all natural cleaning supplies and use organic products to keep chemicals out of my house and body But I chose to get vaccinated and recently boosted against Covid because the risk factor was overwhelmingly obvious With the onset of Omicron the argument about doing it for society has become less powerful and eradicating Covid has also become less likely There s a lot more talk about Covid eventually shifting from pandemic to endemic But here s the stark reality people are still dying from Covid and most of those dying are unvaccinated And in case anyone wants to compare this to just another flu you should know that the worst flu season in recent years killed people in all of Dallas County Eighty Covid shot past that number in the first weeks of arriving in Dallas County I ll make one last comment The Covid deaths have been appalling but it doesn t stop there Many people who survived Covid including those who never had to be hospitalized continue to deal with what s being termed long Covid I know two people personally who have been essentially crippled by the long term effects of the disease and they both caught Covid in prior to a vaccine being available Brain fog crushing fatigue etc One a top nurse administrator in a large hospital had to leave the job and career she loved because she can no longer mentally function at that level The other is living in fear of being fired because he s not performing He can t He falls asleep anytime he sits down even to eat lunch I know nothing I ve shared will convince those who ve chosen to believe otherwise So be it I respect people s rights to make hard choices but hopefully based on accurate information

From This Week s Newsletter WHAT S UP WITH COLORADO AVENUE Just when it seems that things are looking up for Stuart city government may be imperiling the progress that has been made Quality of life issues are taking a toll on civil society throughout the country We are bombarded daily by news of wolf packs of looters in stores increases in other property crimes and a general sense of lawlessness due to local governments forgetting its prime directive keeping citizens safe While Stuart and Martin County s crime rates are low several people have commented on the homeless taking over Colorado Avenue Colorado Avenue has been waiting for revitalization for a decade The City of Stuart has spent thousands of dollars turning the avenue from a highway into a walkable city street It has public art and has had some success with new businesses opening It has even been christened as part of the Creek Arts District That is all in peril now There are many causes of homelessness Drug addiction mental illness and the loss of affordable housing all contribute to what seems to be an intractable problem Stuart and Martin County can t possibly provide adequate housing or more importantly the counselling needed to help That needs to come from the federal and state governments to have any meaningful impact Court decisions have not made it easy to prevent the homeless from setting up camp on public property Yet what about Stuart s residents rights to go for a walk without tripping over someone sleeping on the sidewalk Are the benches on the avenue the private sofas for those without a home I and others have seen men publicly urinating on Colorado Where is our Stuart PD in all of this Again Stuart residents and I have noticed a reduction in police presence in our city The city wants to have people from all over patronize restaurants stores and see the city as an arts center That cannot happen if there is a perception of lawlessness in the very area city fathers want residents and tourists to patronize For a while there was an officer that patrolled downtown on a Segway I haven t seen that since Covid And that patrol was only on the weekends Officers need to go back to the Segway and foot patrol downtown in Flagler Park and on Colorado Avenue Citizens need to feel safe If someone is urinating on the sidewalk that person can be arrested Those benches are for sitting not lounging And the sidewalk should be free of obstructions including of the human kind At the same time we all need to advocate for the homeless Tallahassee and Washington need to provide adequate funding for housing that has a counseling component But we cannot allow the few to dictate what the many can do We tried that in the s and s to devastating results for civil society We need to support the police but the police need to be seen as doing their jobs by the public not just driving by in their cars IF YOU ARE NOT A SUBSCRIBER DO SO FOR FREE

I am proud to announce our campaign has been endorsed by the Texas AFL CIO the state federation of labor unions representing teachers firefighters and farm workers actors and engineers painters and plumbers steelworkers and screenwriters doctors and nurses stagehands and electricians and more The COVID pandemic has transformed our relationship to work I have been in the classroom throughout the pandemic and I have seen the burnout the anxiety the fear on display during otherwise daily tasks It is no secret our teachers and school employees have always been overworked and underpaid But the pandemic has forced us to ask ourselves If we truly believe our schools are educating the leaders of tomorrow then what kind of work are we demanding from our educators It is much more than hard work It is nearly impossible work given the system we are working in I am running for the State Board of Education to change that system so it can work better for all students families and school employees Our work should not be deadly and that means re opening schools safely with extensive input from staff on implementing precautions for a safe working environment Our work should be healthy and that means having access to mental health resources and counselors on campus Our work should be meaningful and that means moving away from high stakes STAAR testing and toward teaching important subjects like service learning digital literacy computer science and ethnic studies I believe the true work on the State Board of Education will begin when the pandemic ends and we will need a new leader with new solutions for the problems we will face in this new world I am ready to work hard for you

Treasure Island Toll Updates From Thanks Jim Steve TI Wine Our intervention at the Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency TIMMA Committee meeting Nov yielded some significant results Apologies for the length but there is much to report For starters we objected to the narrow definition of what businesses qualify for toll subsidies Under food services and distribution only the two island restaurants and the two grocery stores qualified Many non profit organizations on the island didn t qualify because subsidies were available only to employees and many of these groups are staffed by volunteers or depend on either members or clients that come to the island regularly to sustain themselves Wineries and distilleries don t qualify because they don t serve food We pointed out that island businesses did not have an opportunity to have input into these rules even though we asked staff for months to define the parameters of which food service businesses and nonprofits would qualify for subsidies Although TIMMA staff acknowledged they were unaware of the different staffing models used on the island and that this information required further thought and discussion they were unable to give us the details saying they would get back to us with them But the proposal went before the TIMMA Committee a few days later for a vote without our getting the information we had been promised In the Committee discussion that followed Supervisor Matt Haney chair of the committee and the district supervisor for Treasure Island said he didn t understand how long term businesses could be left out of the subsidies and questioned the criteria for inclusion in the program Staff informed Haney that the decision was based on Treasure Island Development Agency TIDA guidance that only resident serving businesses qualified Haney said every time he d been to the island s wineries and distilleries he saw residents there I m not sure I support that approach he said indicating that the policy needed to be revisited That may give our business members another chance to qualify for the subsidies Transit Affordability Staff also presented new affordability proposals to the committee New percent discounts will be instituted for all future moderate and low income travelers to the island That means all future residents and employees of island businesses as well as visitors and customers whose income falls into those categories will qualify This new policy includes complete exemptions for those who qualify as very low income One will have to apply for the income based discounts through a yet to be developed FastTrak program Proof of having qualified for below market rate housing the PUC Care program or Muni Life Line will automatically qualify you for the discounts Otherwise you will have to prove your income status You will have to verify your income every two years to continue the discount In addition staff proposed instituting TI transit passes month and affordability passes for month that will be good for unlimited use on tolls and ferries Note that all the affordability exceptions and programs have been responses to three years of the TIOC constantly hammering that the toll is making the island unaffordable for the low and moderate residents the development was intended to serve and also threatened the survival of the businesses on TI Perhaps most important have been the unanimous calls for No toll coming from residents and businesses Our successes include the resident exemption the subsidies for non profits and food businesses and discounts on the tolls and ferries Ferries Staff announced that a ferry will begin running to San Francisco starting this January The incentive for this new plan did not come about out of some concern for the current residents but because the developers have started selling the market rate read luxury condos on Yerba Buena Island and the ferries are part of the sales enticements The developers will subsidize the cost of the ferries leaving a fare each way to ride until the development s ferry system is up and running in The developer ferry will run every minutes and every minutes during peak times The money the developers will spend on their ferry over the next two years before the project s ferry service begins in will be in addition to the funds they are committed by the Development Agreement to spend on transit infrastructure Board Sailors the Law and the Toll Several members of the San Francisco Board Sailing Association spoke at the meeting The SFBSA advocates for Windsurfers and Kiteboarders Boardsailors to have unrestricted access to San Francisco Bay to create and improve boardsailing launch sites and facilities and to promote and enhance boardsailing safety SFBSA members pointed out that the toll obstructed the public s access to public waterways for recreation Several state laws case law the development s Final EIR the agreement between the City and County of San Francisco and the State Lands Commission and even the legislation AB granting the right to charge a toll on Treasure Island all guarantee that recreational public access right When Supervisor Haney asked staff how the city should deal with the public access issue staff responded that the board sailors could simply pay the new low income version of the toll But nothing in the laws or agreements suggest that public access is dependent on payment of any fees In fact they explicitly are meant to encourage not discourage access and use of these public lands SFBSA members pointed out On Monday Nov the Bay Conservation and Development Commission BCDC the state agency tasked with and empowered to regulate development along the bay s shoreline including Treasure Island s sent TIMMA a letter saying its plan to charge a toll for non resident visitors to TI appears to violate the agreement the city made with BCDC and the permit that authorized the construction That discrepancy could require a review the BCDC said This issue may come up at the Wednesday Nov community outreach meeting Meeting details below All this begs the question Why hasn t the TIMMA planning staff or the City Attorney s office ever addressed this glaring legal liability And how will the FasTrak tolling transponders distinguish which cars carry the hundreds of water and other recreational visitors to the island Another related question How will that toll system deal with HOV vehicles that the toll s enabling legislation AB requires have free access to Treasure Island Moreover how could this project be so far along and behind schedule without someone in the City s legal department having researched and read the laws and policies governing the development Union Crews Since the documents provided for the hearing made no mention of it we asked if the plans for the ferry included using union crews Not only is it the right thing to do to provide jobs with good wages health and retirement benefits the Inlandboatmen s Union ferry workers at ports all throughout the US and Canadian Pacific Coast ports are trained and licensed Able Bodied Seamen experts on safety on the water We were reassured they would have the ferry jobs TI transportation program costs TIOC member Jim Mirowski thanked the TIMMA staff for finally providing some of the financial numbers we have been requesting for some two years But in the presented high level budget for the first five years of the tolls and transportation costs there was little in supporting assumptions no details on traffic patterns toll revenues were not explained and it contained little in the way of cost details on many of the important aspects of the program Mirowski noted that from their own numbers Total program costs for first five years M Shortfalls even with Developer subsidies M Total Cost for the Ferry Shuttle On call Bus to Oakland M Mirowski asked why TIMMA is spending M for the toll program when the incremental total transportation only cost M for the first five years Even with some Federal funding that leaves a shortfall that would require the developer to burn through the remainder of its subsidy fund to cover it He suggested pushing back the implementation of the toll until and subsidize the ferry and bus until In short it would be less cost and could encourage ferry use During Public Comment Mirowski encouraged the Board of Supervisors and TIDA board members to watch the videos of the outreach meetings to witness the level of frustration as fundamental questions the community has been asking for a long time are either ignored or never answered Issues ranged from a lack of an economic impact study updated post Covid traffic forecasts and which businesses qualify for the proposed subsidies to questions regarding the surveys of residents Many of the issues may be larger than the specifics of transportation planning but without the background the community cannot reasonably comment on the proposed toll Most of the project s assumptions were done in and and the world has changed he said We need to stop looking at the project through the soda straw of transportation planning and understand what the economic impact of the toll will be on Treasure Island businesses and the community

Update There s been a lot of news lately about our schools and the numerous challenges they are facing and focusing instead on some positive development at our schools is long overdue We are so fortunate to have an amazing band program at all levels in our school district up through Carlsbad High School Ken Young Robert Galindo and the entire band do an outstanding job At a recent middle school concert Young talked about how many of the top students in each graduating class are in band and it was an impressive number Even more significant only a very small number of the students with the band haven t completed high school The message was clear encourage your kids to stay in band or another similar activity if you want them to succeed There s also a great feeder program Young and Galindo are both involved at the middle school level and transition to the high school is very smooth Kids get to feel included at a very young age Of course band isn t the only local activity that is wonderful for students but it is certainly one that comes to mind for anyone who participated in this past weekend s Martin Luther King Jr march The band led the way Special credit to members of strut also known as the drum line The outstanding drum line participates in community events and parades even when the entire band isn t able to do so Strut won the travelling trophy at last week s Martin Luther King Jr march and they performed at the ceremony as well Members of our band also did a great job at Ricky Garcia s recent awards ceremony They make every event more special It s easy to get caught up in the testing lines and COVID notifications and just feel like that s the only thing going on right now But it s important to stop and remember just how many really neat things are going on at our schools as well Our basketball teams both have winning records and we have kids practicing hard every day at sports such as swimming and wrestling We have after school STEM theater choir BPA programs and numerous other activities We have our incredible band program and students who are so inspired by this activity that they are also improving in school Mostly we have an incredibly dedicated group of men and women who are coaching directing teaching and instructing every day and who are giving our children and grandchildren positive memories that will last a lifetime We can t let the barrage of COVID testing texts cause us to forget about all of the great developments that are taking place as well Sincerely Carlsbad Mayor Dale Janway

WHAT THE FACTS TELL US Clearly the massive rapid Pandemic deficit spending resulted in painful levels of inflation America s infrastructure spending has been deficient for decades Our recent last decades record of infrastructure spending has been fraught with red tape waste and costly delays Take California s high speed rail project as an example Removing over regulation and accelerating needed infrastructure modernization will save trillions of dollars and be good for the environment Massive failures like the California example will kill the desire to invest in the future CBO projections of future deficit levels are almost always underestimates when the projection period is longer than years Why Because the CBO by law uses average economic conditions as the basis for their estimates Any period of time that includes a recession demonstrates deficits far in excess of CBO estimates The US has had a major economic downturn about every years for the las years Rapid efficient infrastructure improvement will promote more painful inflation unless it is accompanied by serious deficit reduction in the form of cuts to government spending that doesn t substantially contribute to future economic growth NOW SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE The choice the American people have made for the last years has been to spend money on themselves and not on a better future world for their children This works for the rich who can still buy a decent future for their kids but leaves the children of average Americans in the lurch Each side of our divided political universe possesses some gut instincts that point us in the right direction Trump supporters were correct that we need to remove unnecessary government intrusion into Americans lives As pointed out above only by removing over regulation can we build the America of the future and make America great again But many conservatives are willfully ignorant about past governmental success stories with the exception of those involving the military This blinds them to the potential for making investments in the future that involve the government Progressives are correct that the government can play and has played a critical role in making America a better place Civil rights social security the interstate highway system and basic science research leading to the Covid vaccine massively improved farming techniques and the internet are just a few examples But progressive idealists can also become overly self indulgent and put too much faith in centralized control resulting in massive debt a bloated wasteful overly intrusive government that stifles liberty and economic vitality This is something conservatives point out to their liberal adversaries all the time We all have something to learn from each other Instead of always fighting one another maybe we should pause and consider that no one has all the answers If we listen we may find part of the answer from the people we usually disagree with That is the path to Making America Great Again In the words of my favorite cartoon character We Are Groot

Today we have one of the more contentious votes in Parliament of the last few years The Government is implementing new measures to try and slow down the spread of the Omicron variant This involves the guidance to work from home where you can extending the use of masks into most non hospitality settings and requiring a lateral flow test to enter larger venues with an exemption for the fully vaccinated While there is much still to learn about the Omicron variant what is clear is that it spreads much more quickly than anything we have seen so far How exactly this will translate into hospitalisations and tragically deaths is something we will come to understand in the weeks and months ahead With infections doubling roughly every two days we will not have long to wait I firmly believe that another lockdown would be devastating for our country especially for children and young people Schools must be kept open and education functioning as our highest priority Many businesses have also been under incredible pressure for much of the last two years and the damage of another lockdown would push many of them over the edge I have spent the last few days going over this with colleagues and Ministers carefully weighing the options available to us and how best to proceed I have been very troubled by the notion of so called vaccine passports My instinct is that they are an affront to British and democratic values and the evidence seems clear that they do not work However I am persuaded that what the Government has come forward with puts the focus on testing with Covid certification as a secondary measure allowing an exemption to testing I will support the Prime Minister in this as there is no compulsion to use them testing is the focus and this seems like a sensible step for high risk venues I would have preferred that testing was the sole element of this policy and I will be urging the Government to drop the use of Covid certification from any future policy decisions Fortunately these are temporary measures that will expire in January of next year when we will have a better idea of what we are facing I am instinctively against further restrictions we must learn to live with this virus We have already felt the dreadful effects of lockdown in lost time with loved ones in lost education and in lost opportunity I fear that there will be more consequences to come as we move into dealing with the legacy of Covid So I will today support the Prime Minister who has led our country through such incredibly challenging times My reservations and concerns persist but I have faith that Boris Johnson will lead us through the darkness as he has before steering a course to recovery once again

Citizens income why it is necessary and how it could be financed In we had David Cameron s big society today we have Boris Johnsons levelling up What we have never really had is a solution to the problem of poverty that has any more substance to it than a sound bite Our Benefits system is designed to be as difficult to use as possible forcing the unemployed and disabled into low wage jobs Things are now so bad that I keep expecting a statement from Priti Patel announcing the return of the workhouse Philip Alston the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights in his final report for the United Nations has said that Poverty is a Political Choice That is certainly true in a country as wealthy as ours There seems to be no shortage of money The Bank of England has printed trillion over the last year in a quantitative easing QE stimulus package Where the problem lies is in the distribution and entitlement to all the wealth What real solutions are there available to us to end the poverty trap that so many find themselves in today We propose as one of the cornerstones of our progressive policies a Citizens Income This would be paid to all UK citizens regardless of their employment status putting an end to the benefits system state pensions family allowance sickness benefits and food banks Children s legal guardians would receive the child s CI on their behalf up until the age of All real poverty in society would finally be alleviated This would end unemployment as it is perceived today and retirement could be at the discretion of the individual CI itself will not be taxed and all income over and above CI being taxed at the same flat rate Having CI enables everyone to live at a basic level without the worry of becoming destitute through a lack of funds The financial stability that CI brings would take the unnecessary stress out of everyday living helping both families and individuals to fulfil their lives more productively An augmented Citizen s Income ACI would be paid to those with disabilities It will not be means tested Also in recognition of their long years of service a Seniority Supplement for all voters over the age of sixty five will also be made CI is basically a dividend as we are all shareholders in UK PLC All well and good except that the amount of money this would cost is astronomical So how could it be financed If CI was a year for each adult and for each child the cost of CI would equal that of the total annual tax revenue that the government currency receives The Green party has a similar policy in their manifest that they would fund with a Carbon Tax They do not however give an estimate as to how much extra revenue a Carbon Tax would bring Whatever the amount such a tax would raise it could never be enough to finance a Citizens Income for all So an alternative way of funding CI needs to be found other than creating a new tax or expecting general taxation on its own to be sufficient What is money and where does it come from We come here to an interesting question what actually is money and where does it come from If you do not already know you may be surprised by the answer Only about of money currently in circulation comes from the Bank of England These are the coins and notes that we use that are made by the royal mint The rest comes from debt and is made electronically by the banks when we borrow from them If you use your bank overdraft or credit card take out a personal loan or mortgage the credit that your bank extends to you is all new money When Theresa May told the nurses that there was no magic money tree she was not being truthful In fact all our money comes from the magic tree i e it comes out of nowhere When we pay it back into our account the money that we have borrowed just disappears again All that is left is the interest that our bank charges us A drawback with this system is that the Central Bank and the Government have little control over the money in the economy So when things occasionally go wrong it can be costly to rectify the problem The last economic crash is an example of this Mostly caused by deregulation because past governments had decided that growth was more important than stability George Osbourn when he became the Chancellor of the Exchequer decided to pay back the government borrowing that resulted from the bailout with an austerity program of reduced spending Coupled with a tax cut for the rich to help stimulate growth This was totally wrong thinking the more governments spend the greater their income because it is their spending that stimulates economic growth Therefore the bailout in the end cost us more than was necessary QE has been used in the past to put money into the economy when the banks have stopped lending The problem with QE is that it puts money into the markets when in fact it is most needed at the lower end of the economic spectrum Another idea for solving this kind of liquidity trap is called a helicopter drop Putting a lot of cash into the economy by Central Banks making payments directly to individuals This has so far never been tried and is like QE a quick fix as opposed to a long term strategy for maintaining a stable economy Direct monetary financing The Governments overdraft facility with the bank of England is a form of direct monetary financing Instead of financing the Government indirectly with QE the Bank of England is now financing them directly This has given them unlimited funds to fight Covid But so far they have made no new Fiscal Policy that takes into account the possible ramifications of having unlimited credit A new idea that is being looked at by the worlds governments and central banks is Central bank digital currency CBDC We are all aware of Bitcoin and other digital currencies The difference between those and a CBDC is that a digital currency made by a central bank would be guaranteed by them So in your central bank digital account would always be worth the same as a note in your wallet Everyone having a CBDC account would give the Bank of England the ability to helicopter drop money directly into the economy if liquidity had become a problem and the economy was stagnating CBDC accounts however could alternatively be used as a way of paying CI to all citizens Without undermining the role that the banks play in generating credit and being a safe place for savings and for making bill payments What are the dangers Putting too much new money into the economy can devalue the pound and cause inflation This is where taxation comes in Taxation is the most affected way of removing surplus cash from the economy Setting tax rates at the right level as well as interest rates can keep the currency stabilised With the added ability to put more money in should it be needed Giving far more control over the economy than is currently possible Five small countries already have a CBDC St Kitts and Nevis Antigua and Barbuda St Lucia Grenada and the Bahama s We should not expect it to be long before larger economies such as ours do the same thing Why not use this opportunity to create a Citizens Income for all and end poverty for

Years ago when I first started working in a private practice setting I had strong ideas about a few issues I wasn t going to work with For one no domestic violence I envisioned angry violent abusers finding their way into my office and I was definitely not going to put myself in those kinds of unsafe circumstances What I soon found out however is that the new client who comes to therapy with symptoms of depression or anxiety or unspecified life stressors may only later disclose violence within a relationship Or more commonly a feeling that something in that relationship just doesn t feel right And while abusers sadly have at times attacked therapists they are more likely to enter the therapist s office as the concerned involved overly attentive spouse or partner at least at first And so I came to work with people dealing with domestic violence Because ready or not they found me And because there was a need I also wasn t going to work too much with trauma I thought I was much better suited to help people with symptoms of depression or anxiety or family issues Until people walked into my office with those types of complaints and proceeded to disclose all of their trauma Or more commonly to describe the overwhelming anxiety that started after a certain experience that they may not have even processed as traumatic I soon found myself searching for trauma focused continuing education and certifications as I laughed at my own naivete If only trauma could be checked off in a neat little box on an intake form Similarly I wasn t looking to focus too much on grief I actually enjoyed doing grief work with people but I didn t envision a large percentage of my working hours being focused on something that could also be emotionally draining But again people who came in with other issues soon shared the grief they were feeling over lost loved ones and lost relationships and lost opportunities I wondered how I ever thought I could limit how much I focused on grief And then came Covid which brought with it more grief and more trauma and yes also more domestic violence as well as addiction and social isolation And those things are currently the focus of most of my work Not because I sought to be a trauma therapist or a grief therapist or someone who specializes in domestic violence but because as therapists we are trained to meet people where they are And right now this is where people are Please don t be afraid to reach out if you or a loved one is struggling We will meet you where you are or find someone who can

CHANGE IS IN THE WIND January Good Wednesday morning Welcome to RUPP S NOTES FBI SPECIAL AGENT HARTMANN SERIES weekly post I m the author Richard V Rupp writing from Burbank California Robocalls are driving me nuts I suspect it has something to do with the work from home thing Both in who is making the calls and the fact more people are at home to receive them Over the past couple of weeks I averaged six to eight a day Today s post is an example of what I did for a living many years ago Advise management based on my research on what changes may impact the business in the foreseeable future But instead of writing a report to senior insurance company management I will present what I foresee to you and use some of the material in my upcoming novel SKYWARD Significant factors that I believe will impact the new normal are Impact of the changing of the guard as Millennials and Gen Z s take over running things This is a shrinking world caused by overpopulation and decreased usable landmass due to climate change The darkening of the populations complexion caused by migration and changing birthrates A move toward socialist structure A move away from fossil fuels and Yes the long term impact caused by the COVID pandemic An example of what the pandemic has done is the consideration by Lloyd s of London to move from their flagship City of London headquarters I spend a lot of time in both the original Lloyds building and its replacement tower designed by British architect Richard Rogers Why the move Because the pandemic speeded up Lloyds move to automation and away from doing business on its underwriting floor A Lloyd s spokesperson said As we adapt to new structures and flexible ways of working we are continuing to carefully think about the future requirements for the spaces and services our marketplace needs Like many other organizations we are considering a range of options around our workspace strategy and the future leasing arrangements for Lloyd s Companies are reassessing their office space as the COVID pandemic showed working from home was viable Lloyd s is just one example of how businesses have been impacted and why office space is now being converted to apartments and condos Millennials and Z s don t live in the past and except for scientific advancements consider historical social information of little value Like my dad used to tell me Don t look in the rearview mirror unless you want to go that way Millennials and Z s are either looking ahead or are looking at a metaverse unreal or make believe world This is evident because they don t believe traditional higher education is of value In fact they think it may slow down their advancement in the world This fall has seen the sharpest enrolment decline among people and older into four year colleges according to Clearinghouse data They see their peers entering the working world through inventiveness tied to electronic devices Doug Shapiro executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center said in an interview Students are questioning the value of college They may be looking at friends who graduated last year or the year before who didn t go and they seem to be doing fine The above concept is also seen in reading habits change A December Gallup poll indicates that fewer people are reading books The average American adult read just over books in the smallest average number than any prior survey dating back to The number of big readers has dropped hard and that s what s weighing on the overall average Currently just report that they read more than books Gallup says down eight percentage points since and lower than every prior measure by at least four points That decline was particularly marked among college graduates and older readers I had to laugh at an article that indicated Men are finally catching up to women when it comes to book reading That s only because women are reading fewer books The Gallup editors conclude Reading appears to be in decline as a favorite way for Americans to spend their free time Millennials and Z s also tie religion to the past and have placed it on the chopping block A recent Pew Research Center report indicates that the number of Americans with no religious affiliation has nearly doubled over the past years from to Self identified Christians dropped from to during the same period Most Americans believe U S democracy is in danger According to a Brookings report one in five Americans has views that make them at least open to if not outright supportive of authoritarianism According to CNN of us are angry about the state of the nation and USA Today indicates that only of us think things are going well think civil war is likely and we are split about equal as to dividing the country into two parts Aogby Analytics ABC News says of us believe the economy is doing poorly And have been adversely affected by inflation Yet according to a Gallup survey of Americans say they are currently thriving the highest number in years The use by large corporations of bots A I and automation in general will significantly increase as the attitude of the workforce changes pushed by the pandemic A record number of U S workers have quit their jobs in the past few months More than million people voluntarily walked away from their positions in November up from million in October November s figure was the highest since the government started tracking the figure two decades ago Government regulations to curb the use of fossil fuels and infrastructure investments will increase the use of electric vehicles and drones The inefficiencies of wind and solar energy will renew the interest in nuclear power The United States and China will dramatically expand their military drones and bots technology The newly developed weapon systems will significantly change warfare The U S may test these new weapon systems in Ukraine with the U S providing advisors to Ukraine if Russian troops invade Finally all of the above convinces me that increased inflation will be with us for the next couple of years It was at in December The cost of food my steaks at Costco have gone up apparel and especially used cars are draining our wallets a lot faster The Federal Reserve is on high alert for how this could affect the economy Back to researching thinking and using the above info in my novel SKYWARD Please be kind to each other and stay safe Cheers Richard V Rupp Author Website www richardvrupp com Email rupprisk gmail com Copyright by Richard V Rupp

I m Joe Larkins a Navy veteran from Gulfport Mississippi and I was years old when I found out I was dying I pretty much came to believe that it was meant to be And so I went ahead and wrote my living will prepared for my disposal when I was gone wrote letters to my friends and talked to my family And I just said You know it s not that big of a deal My time is over I was diagnosed with end stage terminal liver disease caused by chemicals I was exposed to while repairing boats and not taking proper safety precautions The doctors weren t optimistic My liver was deteriorating and I was in agonizing pain I visited the hospital several times a week to drain the waste my liver couldn t process and the doctors told me I would need a liver transplant to survive I had more than once begged my dad to bring me one of my pistols and one of my bullets so that I could go ahead and get it over with the pain and problems of having a terminal illness I had already taken the time to fill out a living will with a DNR so that there wouldn t be any attempts to try to bring me back or put me on life support I got so bad I was actually trying to get into a nursing home because there was just no way that I could live on my own anymore and when I got to a nursing home in November I was on compassionate care through hospice and I was not expected to live through Christmas of that year Although I was on a transplant list even if I got approved they couldn t do it then So either I was going to flat out die or I was going to get a transplant That was five years ago neither have happened Death was knocking at my door I was given about a month to live and then suddenly made a miraculous turn My liver started to regenerate Livers will do that but my doctors did not expect mine to regenerate since it was operating at about Inexplicably to my doctors my liver today is operating at about While most of my doctors won t admit it I m pretty sure I know what s behind my second lease on life I was on all these kinds of harmful narcotic painkillers and Xanax but opioids are bad for your liver because your liver has to process the trash out of your system and opiates are trash I didn t want to be on them But I had a friend who knew I was in pain and wanted to see if she could help ease my pain in the final weeks of my life She d pick me up from the nursing home we d drive somewhere smoke a little marijuana spend some time together and returned to the nursing home You remember me mentioning how I wanted to die Well smoking marijuana removed my desire to accelerate my death It helped me manage my expectations of what life is going to be like with a terminal illness It helped me not only emotionally but also medically My eyes and skin were initially yellow and sickly and that suddenly changed I was like what the hell s going on And my appetite changed so I was able to eat some of my favorite foods again Most of my doctors won t admit it but I m certain I did some research and I found out that it was possible marijuana could help regenerate liver cells So I started to use marijuana more frequently Next thing we know I m well enough that I m getting ready to move out of the nursing home and go to an assisted facility and hopefully progress from there back to living on my own completely One doctor did say he thought marijuana played a positive role and my nurse practitioner agreed as well Recently my nurse practitioner took me off all the narcotics they were giving me and she agreed that if it were not for cannabis I would not be in the position I am now The owners of my nursing home knew about my situation At first I would only smoke off campus and never inside so they didn t care But once COVID came we couldn t have visitors so I couldn t go smoke with my friend I was in pain and didn t want to take narcotics I felt my only option was to smoke inside Again the owners didn t care but they recently got new management that s tied to a larger corporate entity who does not approve The management invited me to voluntarily leave within days but the owners put that on hold to allow me to get my affairs in order Much of the staff and patients actually voted for Initiative last year legalizing medical marijuana for patients with debilitating medical conditions until the state Supreme Court struck it down When the initiative passed everybody here got excited We have residents who because of their different diseases or dementias struggle every day Lots of patients here agree that it will help ease pains fears and erratic behavior I m preparing to move out and found an assisted living facility that I ll soon transition to I m hopeful that one day I ll be able to live independently without any assistance and without fear of punishment I should not be alive I ve been given a second chance at life and I m grateful for that I personally hope medical marijuana becomes law in Mississippi so I don t have to worry about going to jail for using something that is beneficial to me If it weren t for cannabis I wouldn t be here today Joe Larkins Gulfport Mississippi

On behalf of Liberal Democrat Councillors in the Hertford Stortford constituency County Councillor Calvin Horner and the leader of the opposition on East Herts District Council Mione Goldspink have released a joint statement We are appalled by the behaviour of the Prime Minister and his staff at No The revelations about all the various gatherings parties which were held in clear breach of the Covid regulations are shocking The fact that the rules were broken by the very people who had made them is most alarming The parties were being held at the same time as ordinary law abiding citizens were making enormous personal sacrifices in order to keep to the rules They were not able to visit or say good bye to dying relatives they could not attend funerals they could not visit the lonely could not meet friends in a park They suffered real distress and anguish The Prime Minister must take responsibility for the rule breaking in No He did nothing to stop the partying even attending some events himself His claims that he thought that some of the parties were work meetings is pathetic and demonstrates a complete lack of judgement People are angry very angry They have no respect for the Prime Minister who is perceived to be a law breaker and they have no trust whatsoever in him or his judgement We call on him to do the honourable thing and to resign It would be consistent for our MP Julie Marson to similarly urge the Prime Minister to resign Ms Marson is on record as saying that all elected councillors in local government should be worthy of trust How much more should the leader of the Government be worthy of trust We challenge Ms Marson to do the logical thing and herself to call on the Prime Minister to resign

The first evidence of civilisation was identified by anthropologist Margaret Mead as a broken femur which had healed She argued this was the earliest proof that someone had taken the time to care for someone else who d been injured This doesn t happen in the animal world you break a leg and you die and the bone never gets time to heal But this bone had healed which meant that the person was protected while vulnerable and fed and cared for That for her was the start of civilisation The thing that separates us from animals So you have have to ask the question if we don t care for others if we don t feed them if we don t take them in and give them shelter what does that say about us as humans When we trap migrants at borders force them to find illegal help to cross seas cut aid close borders slash benefits or keep all the covid vaccines for ourselves what does that say about modern civilisation

Not often but every once in a while God brings us to a major turning point a great crossroads in our life From that point we either go toward a more and more slow lazy and useless Christian life or we become more and more on fire giving our utmost for His highest our best for His glory Oswald Chambers At the end of I saw posts on social media where people were relieved that was over Surely would be better Covid would go away everyone would get along again and we d get back to normal On January the US capitol was breached Covid like a hydra keeps growing new heads Racial tensions continue to simmer The murder rate in the US increased in as compared to Sexual depravity is the norm The occult is mainstream Two days ago I visited a Barnes and Noble A mother and her teenage daughter were standing next to the occult book section near the main aisle The daughter was arguing with her mother because she wanted to buy a book of spells so she could learn to talk to spirits Thankfully her mom responded with No you don t need that But chances are high that her daughter has been exposed to the occult prior to visiting Barnes and Noble If Mom isn t a believer and can t explain to her daughter why flirting with the occult is dangerous her daughter may eventually get what she wants Youth and adults continue to exit the church Last summer a guy started a website offering a program on how to walk away from the faith Every day the news has stories of church leaders exposed for sexual sin arrogance or spiritual abuse The porn epidemic in the church continues to rage nearly unabated In most churches you won t hear a word about the above Sunday morning The faithful stroll into church Starbucks coffee cups in hand Back to our verse by verse study in Corinthians on spiritual gifts The worship band really rocked it today Hey what s for lunch Zzzzzzzz My family and I spent much of visiting churches of all sizes looking for a new home church we moved to Arizona in Most of the church websites I looked at said Come as you are We didn t hear You can t stay as you are or about the narrow road that leads to life that few find Mathew They want everyone to feel comfortable which is a part of the problem I m not talking about chairs The pastor of one church we visited apologized for giving a message on depression because it wasn t a pleasant topic Another church played secular music immediately after their service The pastor at another church based his sermons on The Chosen and was encouraging the flock to watch that week s episode No wonder people are walking away from the faith churches like this are just another entertainment option I had hoped to find a church that spent time praying Sunday mornings Forget it Gonna have to start a home church if I want that Whatever happened to being devoted to teaching fellowship and prayer Acts confronting the church over its sexual sin as Jesus told us to do in Revelations and challenging people to go all out with God Maybe watching The Chosen will give me the answers I m not knocking the program but we have to discern between Cultural Christianity Christian entertainment and actually doing what has impact and is commanded in Scripture Or maybe I ll leave the TV off and go rogue by spending at least an hour every day in prayer cultivate a passionate love relationship with the Lord and focus on doing what God s word says to do instead of merely studying it Our team at Blazing Grace will continue to expose the sexual sin in the church and offer healing and freedom for those who want it And I ll focus on making my brief life count for eternity and encourage others to do the same Later this month my next book will be released The Way of the Rogue Christian Living a Life that Counts for Eternity The book will challenge and equip you and your church to live a life of spiritual impact and significance More on the book in the weeks ahead will be the year of the Rogue Christian We live in dark times that are getting darker Lukewarm believers will either fade away or they ll keep playing church as long as they don t get offended or forced out of their comfort bubble Then they ll look for another entertainment option oops I mean church Those who aren t playing games with sin or God are the ones who will be tough enough to endure to the end no matter what happens It is the Rogue Christians the doers of the word who are willing to go all the way with God who will make their lives count for eternity And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray And because lawlessness will be increased the love of many will grow cold But the one who endures to the end will be saved Matthew I will leave you with this We see a lot of men who are playing games with pornography and sexual sin They re destroying themselves their marriages their families If this is you please don t wait a day longer Get help now Don t waste your life on the pathetic love counterfeit of lust

If you re a homeowner this could definitely be worth a read for you What is going on in the property market I think last year took so many of us by surprise A continuation of covid and the challenges and excuses it offers Excuses as it seems so many industries used covid as a means of explaining away bad service and delays The challenges however were more evident Whilst the travel hospitality and retail industry were slaughtered other sectors seemed to thrive Car sales and car prices increased as an example Whilst house sales numbers may not have increased the value of property and the eventual sale price certainly did Even from what seemed like a tremendous peak in Estate Agents had to adapt to challenges on staff sickness and knock on effects on opening hours We had to inform ourselves and the market about the ever changing legislation often different from country to country within the British Isles We had to adapt to the ever increasing offers but bear in mind that these offers often came within the first few days So a decision was taken individually on every home for every client on whether we take a substantial offer or hold for closing This of course led to confused vendors and angry buyers who were either annoyed at losing out or being blown away in a closing date Despite all this we felt Regents were best suited to coping and adapting A small professional company can react and turn quicker than a slow corporate We could give the best advice for our area immediately Rather than a corporate one fits all compromise that may have suited no one THIS IS WHY WE WON THE GOLD AWARD FOR DUNFERMLINE AND VOTED SILVER SECOND BEST ESTATE AGENT IN THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND What then for We see the same trends continuing as the market is fuelled not necessarily by lockdown restrictions Brexit or indeed a need and want to spend on property due to savings created by lockdown The driving factor was and remains demand and supply There are too little available homes for the current buyer demand Too few bungalows and property s with gardens for the number of people desperate to purchase Too many flats in short supply for the army of first time buyers and buy to let investors So we are as willing and able as last year to repeat our extraordinary performance in customer care in adaptation and ability to achieve the best outcome for all that give us their trust Reset Prepare Repeat Kindest regards Gary Scott Sales Director estateagent estateagency estateagentsuk SellingOrBuying selling buyingandsellingproperties buyingandsellinghomes buyingahome mortgageadvice mortgage rem regentsestateagents homesfife property propertymarket propertyforsale firsttimebuyer firsttimebuyersuk houseforsale

I had my first bill hearing of the Legislative Session today for HB Maryland Medical Assistance Program Emergency Service Transporters Reimbursement First responders are facing several novel challenges in the field including appropriate funding to confront modern emergencies I appreciate the support on this bill from multiple local jurisdictions and EMS First Responder advocacy groups This bill does a few things First it gradually increases the medicaid emergency service transport reimbursement rate from the current rate by each year until it reaches This gradual increase will ensure EMS are being properly reimbursed to maintain financial solvency for services rendered while allowing the State to appropriately account for this increase MDH has indicated they can handle this gradual increase with existing resources and revenues Secondly this bill allows the reimbursement to be dispersed for treat not transport or TNT This practice is especially prevalent for drug overdoses and similar emergencies where for whatever reason the patient may not be transported to a hospital This will also have some additional unseen savings in situations where an emergency transport would be able to treat a medical issue on site rather than face an incentive to take a patient to an ER to collect the above mentioned reimbursement and further utilize ER resources and space Thirdly we are considering an amendment to include telehealth services in this bill I considered the issue a couple years ago but it was still considered a fairly novel concept at the time However since COVID including telehealth in this area of policy has much broader support to include in the bill this year This will also help to offset some of the cost increases by enabling on site treatment as mentioned above to incorporate telehealth Read more info and keep track of this legislation here

Dear Georgians Day is the day I realized my personal freedoms were in serious jeopardy Since deciding to run for United States Senate here in Georgia that night most Americans have willingly surrendered their personal freedoms hoping for safety provided by government from a virus that poses no serious risk to most Americans They told us not to wear masks Then they told us to wear masks TwoFacedLiars They told us to lock ourselves indoors Then they told us to go outdoors They told us they didn t know anything about the virus They said it was a new virus that definitely came from nature They said that s why the science keeps changing FauciLiedPeopleDied Now we know it definitely came from the Wuhan lab and they have been studying it for years They created it so they knew everything about it CoronaLies So their mask and lockdown orders were lies They knew cloth masks and sending people indoors would help spread the virus FauciTheMonster Many Americans became less healthy intentionally making them more susceptible to serious complications with Covid They waited for vaccines They said don t take the vaccines if they are distributed under Trump NewVaccineTechnology They said if you don t want the vaccine you won t have to inject it into your body Then they said everyone must inject the vaccine no questions asked Shut up and obey or they destroy your life and family VaccineWhip They said it definitely didn t originate from a lab in Wuhan China They banned all talk of the Truth They demanded participation in the MaskLies Most Americans trusted them enough to obey without question They say Trust the Science so as to shut down all critical thought And all the Leaders everywhere obeyed without question This is why I m running for United States Senate in It s why I m recruiting others to run for office FreedomFirst I know how this ends I refuse to bend a knee to Xi Jinping or Fauci That will never happen CancelTheTyrants We are running for office across the country at all levels as Independents who Demand Absolute Truth Love Michael William Fackrell WSWYC GA FackrellforSenate

Biden s latest defeat Supreme Court blocks COVID vaccine mandate for US businesses
BORIS JOHNSON TRIES TO DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE It s a telling observation that not one of Boris Johnson s ministers has been willing to publicly defend or even describe the so called Government s position on the Christmas Party in No last year It is after all indefensible This laughing in the face of the British public exposes the real character of Boris Johnson s vanity Government The claim from the Prime Minister and his ministers has unsurprisingly been that it is their top priority to make certain lives are saved But this latest revelation goes to show that it s easy to make such a claim not so easy to stick to their own rules It takes a moral compass and talent to make good on a promise So let me remind you what we were told around the time this infamous gathering was obviously taking place Johnson was announcing that the planned relaxation of restrictions for up to three households to form a Christmas bubble was being reduced from five days to Christmas Day only This meant that friends and families could only meet on Christmas Day rather than from the period in December as had been previously announced Meanwhile the NHS was flat out while members of Downing Street s elite were apparently taking part in illegal revelry Indeed on that Friday in December there was desperation in many hospital corridors Doctors and nurses were in the middle of a repeat of Covid s first wave earlier in the year The infection rates per people in Rochdale had increased by more than in the seven days leading up to December Pandemic casualties were threatening to overwhelm available wards and overcrowded ICUs Patients were struggling as NHS staff scrambled to find iPads and other equipment so they could be connected to their families who after all were not allowed to visit in person Throughout the country people were dying because ventilators had to be rationed Doctors and nurses described it as being like applying field medicine of a most brutal kind On December we are now being told that members of this Tory government and its advisers were nibbling cheese and quaffing champagne while NHS staffs were tackling the symptoms of those people too weak to have any chance of surviving Covid These included older people and those who needed to be immunosuppressed because of their underlying health conditions It was not as if at the end of last year this was a new phenomenon We had witnessed this horror earlier in the year too But instead of listening to his scientific advisers who had warned of the importance of winter restrictions Johnson hadn t been able to resist the cheap populism of being seen as the one who saved Christmas In fact on December the Covid death toll had reached Just two months later on February it reached Johnson s vanity government effectively cost the country more than deaths from Covid alone in that period It s not good enough and even today they are floundering about playing games with our lives

Closed Door Back Room Deals At City Hall Must End Well this is interesting First off I want you to look at the letters in red at the top of the first page of this document ALDERMEN CONFIDENTIAL closed record This document was never meant to be revealed to the citizens of Parkville Why is that Well I have a few questions Why is the Board of Aldermen planning to build a new luxury apartment complex next to the river inside a floodplain Why are they using the same development firm that destroyed Kansas City s formerly beautiful Berkley Riverfront Park Does the Board of Aldermen think they re spending Monopoly money What will be the impact on English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park What will be the impact of extra traffic on Downtown Parkville Will this benefit the community as a whole or will it just make an already wealthy developer even more wealthy Implications of building this apartment complex inside a floodplain Information from a current Parkville resident Flooding is generally the most common and costliest type of disaster Missouri experiences but standard homeowner s insurance does not cover flooding so it s important to have protection from damage associated with flooding SEMA s Floodplain Management Section administers the National Flood Insurance Program NFIP for the state of Missouri NFIP offers flood insurance to homeowners renters and business owners if their community participates in the program providing more than billion in flood insurance coverage for Missouri homes and business annually Participating communities agree to adopt and enforce floodplain management ordinances that meet or exceed FEMA requirements So the long and short of it is Parkville taxpayers you and me will have to pay in added taxes for flood insurance Impact on Parkville s parks If you remember Berkley Park in Kansas City before Flaherty Collins came in and covered it with apartments it was a large beautiful park on the river with many events festivals concerts etc It was a place where people could gather with their families Now nothing really happens there The only use is for people to walk the river trail Is this what we want for English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park I think not Impact on the businesses in Downtown Parkville Traffic coming through Downtown Parkville can already be congested This new stack em pack em apartment complex would turn downtown and the roads leading into it into a virtual parking lot The businesses there are already struggling trying to come out of the COVID restrictions placed on them by the County Health Board Deterring shoppers from coming into Downtown by creating huge traffic blockages would put the final nail in the coffin for them This is just common sense Anyone can see that except our Board of Aldermen Or maybe they do see it and they just don t care Benefit to the community So the citizens of Parkville will be on the hook for in increased taxes It will ruin English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park That means no more events downtown Parkville Days gone Fourth of July events gone Parkville Microbrew Festival gone Downtown shopping gone These all promote and bring people into the city to spend money Also how does providing the developer Flaherty Collins million million in incentives to build this monstrosity benefit the community as a whole The answer It doesn t So why would the Board of Aldermen even consider this plan And why would they want to keep it secret What else is City Hall hiding from us This is a prime example of why we need a change in City Hall This is why we need to be in the room when these things are being discussed This is why there should be NO private confidential meetings When it comes to issues that are going to have a massive impact on the community and businesses of the city there should be maximum transparency and community oversight It doesn t matter to me how things have always been done If elected Mayor of Parkville I will put you in the room I will be your voice And if the Board of Aldermen don t like that Tough I won t stand by and allow them to Kansas City our Parkville
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE Here s a report from me as to how the Republican establishment threw medical freedom under the bus last week I tried to run an amendment on HB last week My amendment would have given complete protection for Hoosiers by making it illegal for anybody to impose enforce a vaccination upon another person My amendment was called out of order by Representative Dan Leonard and I was told that it was not germane to the bill and that it was bill pending The establishment released HB that same morning and I had drafted my amendment days prior to the release of HB they were saying that I used language from a bill that I did not even know existed at the drafting of my amendment and thus they used one of the House rules to call me out of order How does one draft an amendment from a bill that doesn t exist Answer they can t That is utterly absurd My amendment absolutely had everything to do with HB Representative Dan Leonard who argued with me behind the scenes off camera explaining why my amendment was not germane I explained to him this was a constitutional issue on bodily integrity autonomy and had EVERYTHING to do with HB Representative Leonard just looked at me like I had lost my mind I could only assume Representative Leonard s disdain was because I brought the Constitution into the conversation I then asked Speaker Todd Huston to call down Chairman Representative Heath VanNatter who was the chairman over HB to get a commitment from him to get a hearing and a vote on HB and to be able to announce publicly from the podium that I would withdraw my amendment if I could get the commitment from chairman VanNatter for the hearing and vote Speaker Huston just looked at me disgusted very visibly annoyed and said repetitively and very emphatically to me No No HB would have put a ban on COVID vaccinations But the sad reality is that the establishment did not want to go on record for truly protecting Hoosiers How disgusting

MOSF SF School Board Recall is a Cover for Racism and Elitism Vote No Recalling three members of the San Francisco school board is a case example of how understandable frustration in extraordinarily difficult times gets misunderstood then manipulated and mobilized by racism and wealthy conservatives BIPOC communities and leaders are always impacted and blamed by the dominant culture when the chips are down The chips have definitely been down in this extraordinarily difficult two years of COVID and palpable surfacing wounds of racial trauma It s no wonder that BIPOC leaders such as Alison Collins Faauuga Moliga and Board President Gabriela L pez are taking heat The attempt to recall them is just the latest battleground in displacing San Francisco values and subordinating BIPOC voices MOSF SF School Board Recall is a Cover for Racism and Elitism Vote No

Eastern gorillas are in an utterly desperate situation Their lungs aren t all that different from our lungs and there s a very high chance they can catch Covid With numbers already poached down to a minimum this may turn into a disaster they can t cope with On top of the obvious dangers the pandemic has also ended gorilla tourism ripping the beating heart out of their community led conservation and creating a funding gap that s truly devastating Please help save them If there s not enough funding for rangers the consequences will be unbearable but if everyone reading this donates just you could help keep patrols in the field to protect them

Twenty one of our neighbors in Anne Arundel County lost their lives last week to COVID That s an average of three per day They are not numbers they are human beings with families and friends We are projected to continue losing our people at that rate or higher in the coming weeks I had hoped we were done with government mandates in our COVID response but science is clear that masks slow the spread of this virus Masks keep kids in school workers on the job people out of hospitals and people alive They don t save everyone but they do save some Our hospital leaders pleaded with the County Council to extend the mask mandate citing studies that show more people mask when it s required Of the local businesses that responded to our recent questionnaire nearly two thirds said that they support a government mask mandate They want to protect their employees and the economy that sustains them Of the county residents that sent testimony to our County Council for last Friday s special session supported extension of our mask mandate All of our neighboring counties have implemented temporary mask mandates to address this super surge and the Governor is once again saying Wear the damn mask So what the hell is going on with the Anne Arundel County Republican Party All three of its representatives on the seven member County Council voted Friday to end our county s mask mandate the day after their party sent an anti mask fundraising appeal On November th the same three council members voted against accepting million in desperately needed state grants to continue our Health Department s COVID vaccination program testing and opioid intervention work It s a strange development The Baltimore County Council also has a seven person council with three Republicans on it and they put together a person supermajority in favor of a mask mandate Republican led counties across the state are eagerly accepting state grants to combat this virus I m often told by keyboard activists from the far right that my commitment to slow the spread of this virus in our county will cost me the next election a risk I take willingly The unfortunate reality however is that it s not just an online fringe that is challenging the longstanding consensus that public health and public safety are a fundamental obligation of government It s also the party leadership and even the candidates who are running campaigns to put themselves in this job Herb McMillan uses this newspaper as his vehicle to weave circular logic about COVID that would likely be banned by Twitter and Facebook and the political machine behind Jessica Haire uses expensive television ads during Fox News The Haire campaign chaired by her husband and transitory candidate for County Executive Dirk Haire went so far as to run television ads in recent weeks suggesting that business closures early in the pandemic the ones that were mandated by Governor Hogan were a failure of leadership I won t shrink away from the debate over the obligation of government to protect its people the longstanding bi partisan American tradition of government driven vaccination programs and health orders and even the specifics of every difficult decision that I the Governor and my peers in neighboring counties have made during this pandemic in consultation with our health officers This county s Republican Party used to represent fiscal conservatism and a healthy disdain for excessive regulation It has recently become so ferociously opposed to delivering the basic functions of local government that its leaders are no longer capable of managing the public institutions that they malign So as we enter this election year we must show passion in defense of our local public servants and the work that they do on behalf of our residents We must show the contrasts between the progress we are making and efforts to undermine that progress And we must never back down in defense of our right to protect the health and safety of our beloved neighbors

LOCKDOWN LINA is at it again Instead of consulting with medical experts at any of the major hospitals in the world s largest medical center right here in Harris County Lina is making her own uninformed misguided and irresponsible decisions about the COVID pandemic Her latest red alert is nothing more than another national self idolizing publicity stunt that infringes on the rights and liberty of families churches businesses and every law abiding citizen in Harris County And we all know what s coming next Lockdown Lina is undoubtedly coming after the HOUSTON RODEO I ve served for three decades on the Board of Houston Methodist Hospital and as Harris County Judge I will work with our health system maximize the use of our current resources and expertise at the Texas Medical Center and trust the people of Harris County to make the best decisions for themselves and their families

It ended with a spectacular own goal and its leader showing incredibly bad judgement for the umpteenth time in recent months but I believe privately most National MPs are relieved it ended this way No need for a messy coup and a Game of Thrones style forming alliances to outwit the Lannisters I m surprised Judith lasted this long Her constantly negative strategy with most of her recent gripes seeming to be about easing restrictions a few days earlier all delivered in a bitter Karenesque tone as if she was appealing to the manager of Covid for certainty I think it will be Luxon v Bridges for the top job Mark Mitchell if neither of them want it Luxon mysteriously polls on preferred PM polls despite the fact no one has a clue what he s like as a politician I put this down with the misguided belief many have that successful businessmen are the best equipped people to run a country Maximising profits and cutting costs to appease your shareholders may work in commerce but won t help you maintain hospitals stop the poor from either starving or running riot or giving the next generation a chance of a decent future Bridges has been leader before of course He s smart but gaffe prone and has had his own lapses in judgement such as his infamous social media rant I think Simon will win

A LITTLE CLARITY PLEASE Let me be the first to say I appreciate the fact that we still have a local newspaper that covers local news While the AP articles are not always unbiased I continue to support and subscribe as I have for many years Most of the time I feel I am quoted accurately however I feel the need to clarify the verbiage of a few quotes attributed to me in a recent article First I did not describe the Save Women Sports Act as ensuring transgender women cannot participate in women s sports Instead I have been consistent in stating that BIOLOGICAL MALES should not be allowed to compete against girls and women This is important to me because use of the woke term transgender women implies that a person can actually change their sex This is not only scientifically impossible but in my opinion gives people the false belief they can do so Second the article stated I supported a bill to ban critical race theory although critical race theory is not in the state s school curriculum Unfortunately the latter is often repeated media commentary not my words CRT has been included in curriculum at USC and Clemson in teacher training nationwide and likely at some SC public schools based on the numerous complaints of concerned parents While the words critical race theory are not necessarily used the tenets of the theory include the teaching that an individual by virtue of his race or sex is inherently racist sexist or oppressive whether consciously or unconsciously and an individual should feel guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race or sex I said to the Index that no one should be taught to be ashamed of their race in our state and I stand by that statement Finally I pointed out that the courts are currently dealing with federal COVID mandates and there is not a lot that a state legislature can do This does not mean that we have not tried to ban mandates nor does it mean there is no role for the legislature in responding to the pandemic In partnership with Governor McMaster we have certainly been involved in allocating both state and federal funds on an emergency basis to mitigate the pandemic for the last two years Index thank you for allowing me to clarify these quotes If you want to print this as my letter to the editor please feel free to do so

Market Highlight December th The emergence of the new Omicron coronavirus variant along with a hawkish pivot by the Federal Reserve Fed kicked off a period of elevated market volatility the past couple of weeks Fortunately the economy has strong momentum in terms of both real and nominal growth heading into any potential Omicron slowdown As for the Fed in an appearance before Congress Jay Powell acknowledged inflation has been higher and more persistent than expected effectively retiring the term transitory and raised concern that Omicron has the potential to exacerbate inflationary pressures further As such he signaled that the Fed would likely turn its attention away from supporting the economy towards fighting inflation beginning with an accelerated tapering of its bond buying program beginning this month This pivot should not be viewed as risk friendly for the markets particularly for the highly valued speculative stocks that previously benefited from low volatility and extraordinary liquidity There is a clear disconnect at present between strong economic growth high rates of inflation and the Federal Funds rate at The Fed s emergency liquidity measures should have ended long ago and will now be more difficult and painful to correct We believe there are a number of favorable growth drivers that should help us rebound from any Omicron slowdown including global reopening a housing rebound an auto rebound and inventory replenishment The US consumer remains in great shape excess savings and record high net worth and in position to power the economy ahead as confidence recovers We continue to actively monitor risks such as margin pressures caused by rising input costs an inflationary wage price spiral that forces the Fed to act sooner and more forcefully than expected new Big Tech regulatory or legislative constraints geopolitical conflicts Russia Ukraine China Taiwan and additional Covid disruptions that could once again impede the recovery READ THE FULL REPORT InvestmentStrategies AtlantaGA Fiduciary RIA InvestmentManagement PortfolioManagement RiskManagement Investing InvestmentAdviser AssetAllocation WealthManagement AssetManager InvestmentManager AssetManagement activemanagement activemanager Disclosure bit ly kwUQuk

sermon on II Peter Let Us Prepare the Way In accordance with God s promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth where righteousness is at home Not to scandalize you but there is a sacrilegious joke I want to tell you Not to shock you but to redeem its punch line The joke which is a riff on end time Christianity goes like this Jesus is coming Look busy It s not a great joke but I think it has a truth that can bless us Jesus is coming Look busy or better yet get busy Get to work doing what Jesus wants us to do to make this world welcome for him and for us all That is what Advent is all about Advent is a season of preparation to make the way ready for the King of kings and Lord of lords If only I was as intentional about doing that as Home Depot is The first Christmas items appeared at Home Depot before Labor Day Go in there today and you ll find the place plastered with poinsettias and home decorations and artificial trees and on and on and on If I was as serious about making Jesus welcome as Home Depot is about making a buck my faith would really move mountains The journalist Nicholas Kristof has an annual column about alternative Christmas giving This year he touted a project called Cure Blindness which offers cataract surgery for poor people in Asia and Africa will restore a person s sight Another organization Campaign for Female Education seeks to get African girls in school and out of child marriages will educate a girl for one year in high school will cover a year of elementary school This program has enabled young African women to get their education and to pay it forward because each graduate mentors and sponsors another girl Talk about changing the world Yes there is only one Savior of the world But by the grace of God it is amazing what we can do to help in that saving work The Youth Service Bureau s Project ReinDEAR the local CASA program sponsoring a child through Compassion International Think of all the wonderful ways we can be about the Lord s work by making things just a little bit more right and good and just and loving See if you can include some alternative Christmas gifts in your gifting this year Instead of another sweater Uncle Harold might really like a Heifer Project duck Cousin Mary might appreciate a gift being given in her name rather than receiving a gift herself Try it and see how that changes the feel and meaning of Christmas for you for good We re in the middle of a pandemic an economic crisis and a poisonous political climate All of that can make us feel pretty powerless After all none of us is going to come up the cure for Covid But we can wear a mask and practice social distancing while we wait for the vaccine to arrive which thankfully is on its way Doing what we can do while we wait is a God given power all of us have And that is what God wants us to do while we wait for God s kingdom to come in full We are to anticipate that reality which only God can bring by doing those things which only we can do As we do what is within our power to do we prepare the way and hasten that day when our Savior fully reigns when righteousness is truly at home when this tired old universe and sin sick world are transformed into a new heavens and a new earth If you think that our power to prepare the way for something that big is just a lot of hype then you have a bunch of geophysicists who will disagree with you During the lock down earlier this year when we all stayed home geologists who monitor tremors and watch for earthquakes reported that the lock down actually decreased the amount of surface tremor for the entire planet Turns out that when billion people do something small it adds up to something that is pretty big Don t underestimate what God can and will do in and through you Your actions have consequences And when you act with God eternally powerful things happen Getting sober Forgiving an enemy Burying a grudge Mentoring a child Living with hope Sharing in love These gospel acts are the basic building blocks of the Kingdom of God So don t just spend this month getting ready for Christmas Get ready for your Savior Welcome him Don t wait passively Do what you can where you are as the Lord leads you As you do you will welcome Christ into your life which shall be blessed and into the world which shall be changed Let us prepare the way In reading this your heart may be stirred What you re feeling is the Holy Spirit drawing you to Christ To begin or renew a relationship with Jesus just pray Lord help me receive your love I regret the wrong I ve done Forgive me Jesus I believe you are God s Son and the Savior of the world Be my Savior Save me from myself Save me for yourself Enter my heart Fill me with your Holy Spirit Help me to serve you faithfully and well Help me to love as you love Lead me in your Way Truth and Life now and forever Continue to show me who you are and who I am in you Amen If you pray this prayer find a pastor They ll show you how to live for Christ with purpose peace and joy Jesus says Behold I make all things new That definitely includes YOU

Warning to the Vaccine Passport People We will not follow you into captivity You are separating from those of us who value freedom This is a very important moment in Time Pay close attention and think critically You are agreeing to give control over your body to TwoFacedLiars Please take time to do some self reflection Consider how you have changed since the introduction of the Coronavirus into your life Consider all the lies The virus was new definitely from nature It started spreading in December with the first cases in January Fauci knew nothing about it but was absolutely certain it didn t come from the lab Don t wear a mask Then wear a cloth mask Definitely no mandates Definitely back to usual when we have vaccines This is how liars operate You are being deceived by our government They are hurting you They are lying to you Fauci Biden and many other political bureaucrats have been engaged in a full blown Live Lab Test on the American people They re testing a NewVaccineTechnology that was way too dangerous for such widespread use prior to the release of the Coronavirus Our own government has ownership in the Coronavirus vaccine technology It s their baby They birthed their rotten baby on the American people Everything they have done since March when this rotten plan was hatched has been for the express purpose of spreading the virus as much as possible so they could claim success with the vaccines They deployed a lightweight version knowing that herd immunity would be reached quickly and quietly so as to keep people in the dark Then after months of miserable lockdowns that helped spread the virus people were so desperate they would accept their rotten vaccine technology without question They made us miserable so we would happily accept a New Vaccine Technology under Emergency Use Authorization regardless of whether or not we needed it They locked us up and provided their vaccines as a key to our freedom Those who agreed to participate in this lie are not free You are bound by a lie I strongly encourage you to ditch your Vaccine Passport and only wear a mask for honest reasons This is indeed the times warned of in Revelations because this entire thing is based on lies The whole thing The masks are a lie Cloth masks do not protect you from the Coronavirus Everyone wearing a cloth mask for protection from the Coronavirus is wearing a lie That lie is tearing our country apart Most people do not need a vaccine for protection from Covid yet most people are getting it anyway Those who are doing so for the purpose of praise to show others are leading people towards the father of lies You are wearing the mark The mark represents a lie It s Satan s team symbol Wearing a mask for any reason other than the absolute truth is to wear a lie mark Injecting a Coronavirus vaccine into your body because you want to show others while claiming that you are doing it because you honestly believe that you need it is to inject a lie into your body You will know in your heart if you are being honest That s between you and God Mistakes happen Should you find yourself wondering why you got the vaccine or are wearing a mask it s a good time to start asking God to help you find your mistakes Pray for Truth God loves Truth He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword Here is the patience and the faith of the saints Revelation And there followed another angel saying Babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication And the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice If any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name Here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus Revelation Saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing Revelation Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is new Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name Revelation

Today we will be arguing the case of Brach v Newsom before the th Circuit This is the case we filed in the summer or when tyrant Newsom shut down schools in California even though every scientist knew that children where not having severe adverse reactions to COVID and that even if children were getting it they were not spreading it to adults This case is about the state not being allowed to interfere with parent s right to send their children to private school and about the state being able to provide a minimum level of education to all children
This is not a political post its a post about economics After serving over years in the Senate you d think Joe would have a better understanding of the economics of oil and gas exploration and production and the direct impact on gasoline prices at the pump He is so pro Green everything and so anti oil gas that he has scared off many public and private oil and gas exploration and production companies from investing in new drilling and production even though oil and nat gas prices are high and profitable at the moment So we re going to continue to see less budgeting in the oil and gas companies to find new oil and natural gas to bring to the market Which will lead to less oil and nat gas supplies and increasing demand as we exit Covid and therefore higher prices So expect higher oil and higher natural gas prices and therefore higher gasoline prices in the near future Biden has weaponized his political power and Americans are hurting because of it

With the war in the Middle East that recently ended rising tensions with China and now talks of war with Russia there is one common thread Our nation s weakness is our reliance on other countries that don t have our best interests We saw this when COVID hit in March of our production of masks tests ventilators all done overseas by China When it comes to energy Russia and the Middle East have had much control over our energy resources What kind of nation relies on other rival nations for our most valuable resources One that is in a weak position Energy security IS national security In restoring our country we must not be reliant on others for our energy Under President Trump we received barrels of oil a day while under Biden we are receiving over times that amount As a result we ve seen gas and energy prices skyrocket across the country This is what happens when you destroy American energy independence Right now we are seeing the repercussions of Biden s failing energy policies Nations are becoming more reliant on Russian energy creating instability around the world You can see this in Germany with their reluctance to support Ukraine Again energy security is national security But most importantly the idea that we should send our young men and women overseas to fight for the nations that refuse to send their own is insane Why should we fight for nations that are scared to upset their energy provider When our allies are not energy independent that too is a national security risk for us So what s the bottom line To keep Americans safe we need strong national security To have strong national security we need strong energy security With us and our allies relying on opposing nations for energy we are putting Americans last and our enemies first In running for Congress becoming an energy independent nation is something that we will continue fighting for America does not need to fight another endless war over energy we ve already shed too much blood

When I first came to UK I had to take clearance exams to become a registered doctor in UK along with a language exam two exams that only non EU doctors have to take racism I also did a Masters from Barts in Public Health and during those phases I was introduced with a cornerstone of UK and EU medical ethics called Informed Patient Consent Choice IPC Now let me make absolutely clear if you are offered the vaccine you should take it I have seen mortality and morbidity due to Covid and I will always ADVISE taking the vaccine But I DO NOT support a vaccine mandate IPC is an essential pillar of General Medical Council and EU Medical Council and it is a novel Western concept that took ages to develop after the horrors of the medical experiments that were carried out during the holocaust and by Japanese scientists in China Korea and Philipines The way countries like Germany Austria Netherlands and other EU countries are mandating vaccines is an affront to IPC amd undermines the most enlightened medical ethics in the st century It is also opening up a can of worms in the field of medical ethics Will HIV and Hepatitis B treatments be made mandatory in future as they have the chance of mass spread in multiple ways Where do we draw the line In the end all I can hope is the UK govt refrains from further lockdowns and do not impose a vaccine mandate Photo Credit The Daily Mail and Sky

During this year s Living Wage Week the local branch of UNISON the public service union is calling for a pay rise for hundreds of Portsmouth social care workers Portsmouth City UNISON is calling on employers and funders to boost the pay of care workers to at least the Living Wage of per hour an increase of over a year for the lowest paid Across the country five million people are still paid below the real Living Wage Two thirds of them are women as women dominate careers that are notoriously underpaid and undervalued In the context of cuts to Universal Credit soaring household bills and empty promises of levelling up and a high wage economy the real Living Wage offers an important benchmark Chair of Portsmouth City UNISON branch Jon Woods said Social care workers have put their lives on the line during the covid pandemic delivering highly skilled personal care and support yet they are amongst the lowest paid No wonder there is a crisis in social care when you can be paid more for flipping burgers and pulling pints than for looking after the most vulnerable people in society Social care employers Councils and Central government must step up to the plate to fund and implement the living wage now

SECRET BRITAIN What drives a NHS nurse to do a solid twelve hour shift In the UK one of our biggest assets is the National Health Service The public choose to protect it serve it and nurture it Everyone born and raised in the UK will have utilised the NHS at some point or even just visiting the UK and were unfortunately in need of medical attention NHS nurses are God s angels ready to dispense a much needed joke to ease your discomfort and stress or shield you at your most vulnerable Comforting a child at bed time who is away from their parents for the first time with a cup of hot milk and then marvelling and rejoicing at their recovery When one mature male patient had to have a catheter put in a delicate region his horror was obvious but the NHS nurse had a way of calming him down and getting past his male ego and he was like a little boy again in her professional hands ready to do as she said and quickly eased into a routine Marie Curie Nurses help people living with terminal illness and who want to be cared for and die in the dignity of their own home peacefully They will do daily spot checks and co ordinate times with family members to administer pain relief and medicine It s a tireless affair turning up rain or shine to make sure your patients who rely on you are cared for They don t care if you are a saint or a sinner or even refuse to rally their cause Rich or poor everyone is treated the same under their care and supervision Then of course there was our own Prime Minster Boris Johnson when suffering from Covid it was the NHS nurses who rallied around him and kept an all night and day vigil in his most dangerous hours Try standing for one hour on the same spot let alone an all night vigil it s tiring and hard work What drives such a selfless service of care because they are not paid top dollar they are only making enough to survive and a little more for reasonable extras It s certainly not money or blood ties It s a genuine desire to serve and protect their communities Of course there are other great inspirational stories like the check out girl who must be in her late teens to early s Claire works at a Tesco supermarket and as the familiar beep was sounding off as your items that you can t live without were going down the till she began to look guilty and forlorn It was the first week of the pandemic in March when the whole world was frightened about this unknown disease and had thought there was a potential the world could end All what seems a far away thought now but at the time it seemed very very real because little was known about Covid and the consequences it could herald Claire explained she felt guilty about going to work today The customer was glad she had attended afterall how would they get their lifeline groceries home to feed and sustain themselves Claire explained her Mother had kept crying that morning when she had insisted she call in sick in the first lockdown because she was fearful for her daughter s wellbeing in the face of an unknown virus But Claire insisted she could not let work and customers down but deep down she was scared too Claire was the epitome of grace and strength because she had a beautiful soul that shone like a beacon of light despite her neutral check out uniform Her inner beauty far eclipsed any venerated heiress or celebrity Turning up to work that day was an act of courage despite the emotional turmoil she faced inwards and outwards from her loved ones She is not the only one there is the post man who would wear gloves in the first pandemic frightened to get close to you and would hastily leave your life line of parcels at your door in a hurry once he realised you were aware you had parcels Those parcels meant a lot to people during lockdowns and was the few links to the outside world and we relied more than ever on the network of key workers to keep us going What motivates a NHS Nurse to do a twelve hour shift Often without breaks and little recognition It s a selfless drive discipline and genuine care for the wider community which keeps NHS Nurses serving and without them in our hour of need we would be truly lost without these pillars of the community

CNN Business A rise in global crude oil supply could put the brakes on surging gasoline prices that have hit record levels in parts of the United States and Europe According to the International Energy Agency s latest market report global oil supplies jumped by million barrels per day in October with the United States accounting for half that increase as Gulf of Mexico output recovered from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida in August The Paris based agency said it expected a further boost of million barrels per day over November and December with the United States forecast to provide more of that increase than any other country The world oil market remains tight by all measures but a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon it said Prices for US and Brent crude oil are trading near six week highs at and a barrel That s left drivers in California paying a record per gallon for gasoline according to AAA Europe hasn t escaped either Prices hit record highs in the United Kingdom last month The IEA said it expected output to increase in the next two months despite the OPEC group of oil producing countries declining appeals from US President Joe Biden to ramp up production beyond a planned monthly increment of barrels per day The agency said it had raised its US output forecast by barrels per day for the fourth quarter and by barrels per day on average in as high prices encourage higher output That increase will go some way to meet rising demand still recovering from the Covid slump the report said adding that refinery production was also on the rise again following maintenance over autumn The agency raised its global gasoline demand forecast for the last quarter of by barrels per day after seeing end user demand on track to strengthen further over the rest of the year as more countries open up to international travel people become more mobile and Covid vaccination campaigns pick up

A message from Telescope Health Co founder COO Dr Matthew Thompson regarding the Omicron variant and COVID vaccines Breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated are expected but vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness hospitalizations and death Evidence suggests fully vaccinated people who become infected with the Omicron variant can still spread the virus to others so use caution around family and friends who are at high risk All FDA approved or authorized vaccines are expected to be effective against severe illness hospitalizations and deaths Additionally Omicron has been associated with higher rates of false negative rapid tests If you are worried about an exposure or have symptoms and your rapid test is negative get a PCR test also What else can you do Go get your booster especially if you are years of age or have risk factors Use common sense and avoid close contact with anyone who has active symptoms If you are going to be in a crowd of people concert sporting event etc wear a mask Learn more about the Omicron variant from CDC Global

Biden Releases Million Barrels of Oil What s Missing November By Sam Madden Biden announced recently that Million Barrels of Oil from the United States Strategic Oil Reserve to combat higher prices at the pump Will this have an effect on gas prices for the consumer Also is there anything missing in this equation that the media or the Biden Administration is not taking into consideration In the U S consumed nearly Million Barrels a day which has only been increasing in as Covid restrictions have been loosened and Americans are traveling more So this release of Oil from the Strategic Reserve is less than days with of oil consumption by consumers in the United States This has been pointed out by many saying that this small supply of oil will have little effect on prices at the pump What is missing is that the U S will be selling oil at a wholesale price of approximately per Barrel This comes to Trillion into the Government s Coffers So it s not a bad time to release this oil that is sitting idle while our Government continues to run a deficit Ideally when the Biden Administration replenishes the oil that is sold into the market the price will be lower than when the U S Government buys it back And if they plan their purchases properly just as a prudent investor in the stock market would they would not buy it all at once but in little pieces so as not to drive up the price Sources Sam Madden is a Free Lance Writer and Research Professional at He can be reached at samuel madden yahoo com or on Twitter

I have received an overwhelming number of emails regarding the mask mandate both in favor and in opposition I have read and appreciate each and every one of them It is important that citizens are engaged and regardless of your position let elected officials know your thoughts I do want to be clear and let everyone know where I stand specifically in reference to the mask mandate Prior to being elected in November I campaigned on being a champion for parental rights Having said that I will only support optional mask wearing If parents want to have their children masked they certainly are entitled to that right and with that parents who choose to not have their children masked should also have that same right extended to them I am aware of Governor Youngkin s Executive Order and SB Senator Dunnavant the patron of that bi partisan legislation who is a practicing physician stated this legislation was not intended to force school systems to follow CDC recommendations regarding masks Hint The word recommendation is important here SB also uses terms such as to the maximum extent possible which lends itself to interpretation Having said that I do believe we must continue to be diligent in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID My suggestions to the Board have included ideas such as improved air quality measures air filtration systems UV lighting etc increased on site testing in schools VISSTA a model already being used by other localities in Virginia and ongoing physical distancing and sanitation measures I look forward to today s retreat and robust conversation with fellow board members regarding the above mentioned thoughts I am hopeful we can walk away with a plan that ends mask mandates while still working to keep children and families in Augusta County safe and well

We re on day two of requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test for dining in The logistics have actually been pretty easy and customers have been cheerful and almost all appreciative Thanks But the reality is there haven t been very many of you here It s been very cold and January is always a slow month so may or may not be because of the mandate We don t know if our experience is shared by restaurants all over the city but guessing it s pretty likely there are many restaurants across the city right now with owners that are staring at very empty dining rooms and not sure what s next At Common Roots we ll work our way through this and look forward to warmer less covid y times ahead but the truth is the financial numbers are worse these weeks than at any point in the past couple years It was much harder to operate last year but we also had very large government support programs to help us keep going and employ people Those programs are gone A small portion of restaurants got very large grants from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund but most got nothing We were in the nothing group And now we have a vaccine mandate as a new unknown We support the mandate It s the right thing for public safety for helping to try to keep our customers safe and our hospitals and medical staff from being even more excessively over strained But it s also a big unknown for restaurants will less people show up Is this one more thing that suppresses sales even more and asks more of our staff in an already bad time Or maybe this will actually make more people feel safe dining out We don t know the answer yet But we re sure this would be an excellent time to buy something from your favorite restaurants Go out to eat if you re comfortable doing so order to go or delivery if you re still hesitant to dine out And for our city leaders of all kinds elected officials media religious leaders neighborhood leaders people who have lots of friends whatever this would be a great time to encourage people who can afford to and feel comfortable doing so to get some great food or drink from small businesses they love and want to continue to have in their neighborhoods We can have a vaccine mandate AND rally support for our restaurants As for Common Roots we ve added Friday Night Family Meal boxes and Care Package deliveries which are helping keep some staff busy And we ll be creatively trying to keep our minds focusing on Patio season that can t be that far away already right We re serving up good food and drink in our cafe private dining room and for pickup or delivery Wed Friday a p Sat Sun a p We re looking forward to the day when our hospitals aren t near full our front line workers aren t exhausted and we can be around people in public spaces and not be thinking about risks We re all on our way to that place It s just a meandering path we re all on together
Those of us with deep roots in the community remember well the problems we had with anti social behaviour in the Morrisons car park area when the store first opened This time it is not the boy racer drivers that are the problem but people using the skate park after dark to create their own sculptures from shopping carts We don t want this to be a tipping point for the old behaviours to return We know Morrisions have deactivated all the tokens on the carts as a Covid reduction measure Understandable Less understandable is the car park left unlocked after trading hours and no real attempt to secure the shopping carts to prevent this type of behaviour Local Labour activists such as the one who took these photos are in the process of contacting Morrisons to see what can be done to address what could develop into more serious issues Local Labour Local Activism

RESPONSE TO VERN BUCHANAN R FL CHALLENGES The opinion by Congressman Vern Buchanan R FL captioned We must address the challenges we face in in the Sarasota Herald Tribune Jan skews priorities Buchanan says not a word about the continuing pandemic and escalating infections hospitalizations and deaths With the Omicron variant spreading rapidly the United States is averaging over new Covid cases a day higher than at any previous point and Florida is in the vanguard Buchanan also fails to appreciate the broader healthcare crisis and the need for quality affordable healthcare for all Buchanan voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times with no viable substitute Moreover with eight of the ten oldest Congressional districts including FL in Florida he voted repeatedly to turn Medicare into a premium support vouchers system and to cut health funding He has also consistently opposed choice and women s interests voting against the Women s Health Protection Act Paycheck Fairness Act and Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act Nor does Buchanan recognize that our democratic republic too is ailing Spurred by exhortations by the then president to Stop the Steal and Fight Like Hell thousands of armed rioters stormed the United States Capitol on January and at least five people died as a result Nevertheless Buchanan was among Republicans boycotting the Special Committee to Investigate the January Attack and declining to join the Congressional commemoration a year later Moreover restrictive voter laws passed in various states in but Buchanan is unconcerned over efforts to subvert elections and civil rights by voter suppression and gerrymandering He most recently voted nay on the Voter Rights Advancement Act While Buchanan does appreciate that it s the economy stupid he fails to offer viable suggestions Obviously inflation and consumer prices have spiked way too high but at least unemployment has dropped below and other economic indicators have improved significantly Meanwhile Buchanan s own selfish economic priority has been to vote for and tout the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with or so of benefits going to corporations and individuals in the top On deficits and debt Buchanan hypes his proposal to amend the United States Constitution to require a balanced federal budget While the idea of balanced budgets is itself appealing such an amendment would deprive federal policymakers of essential flexibility to address national security and economic emergencies On the environment one looks in vain for any reference to climate change Extreme weather events in many exacerbated by climate change set new records around the world Time is short to forestall a global catastrophe As to other environmental issues Buchanan holding a roundtable on red tide and working to protect manatees and other species are noble efforts But these do not compensate for ignoring climate science One could go on and on about challenges Buchanan wholly or partially disregards On foreign policy yes the Biden administration bungled the withdrawal from Afghanistan but rather than this being the biggest foreign policy disaster in a generation it got us out of the longest war in U S history On law enforcement yes crime is skyrocketing defund the police is a ridiculous slogan and the vast majority of our first responders are brave and honorable but there are abuses many discriminatory that must be remedied And yes our porous southern border is of great concern as are all kinds of drug trafficking but an ugly wall of rusting steel has not proven effective To end where Buchanan began asserting that Americans have seemingly never been more divided than under President Joe Biden is absurd Remember the lies of the last presidency culminating in an insurrection

Monthly Market Summary A high level look at factors impacting the financial market The U S equity market finished the year on a strong note as the S P Index gained in December Defensive issues led the way as concerns and uncertainty regarding the Omicron variant caused investors to consider a possible slowing of economic activity Consumer Staples Real Estate and Health Care were the leading sectors while Consumer Discretionary was the worst performing sector Large and mid cap stocks outperformed small caps and value outperformed growth across all market cap ranges The Omicron variant is spreading rapidly leading to spiking case counts but very low fatalities The South African experience suggests it should flame out quickly Widespread lockdowns are unlikely however consumer caution will likely temper growth and extend supply chain disruptions similar to Delta The economy has strong momentum and should be able to absorb another Covid slowdown Persistent red hot inflation a function of too much demand extraordinary monetary fiscal stimulus and too little supply Covid impact has forced the Federal Reserve s Fed hand to an accelerated taper of bond purchases and three possible rate hikes in While monetary policy remains highly accommodative the Fed pivot to fighting inflation is not risk friendly Positive growth drivers in include a global reopening b housing and auto rebound and c inventory replenishment In addition the US consumer remains in great shape and in a position to power the economy forward as confidence recovers S P earnings estimates have continued to move higher boosted by strong nominal growth pricing power and productivity gains however Q Q estimates could get revised lower in the near term due to Omicron We continue to believe a balance of high quality cyclical and secular growth stocks is appropriate at this time given the many uncertainties related to Covid fiscal and monetary policy and bond yields We remain highly convicted in those stocks whose positions were strengthened as a result of this pandemic and are therefore poised to perform well as the economy fully reopens and returns to a more normal state These stocks remain reasonably priced and are expected to deliver above average profit growth in the year ahead REPORT InvestmentStrategies AtlantaGA Fiduciary RIA InvestmentManagement PortfolioManagement RiskManagement Investing InvestmentAdviser AssetAllocation WealthManagement AssetManager InvestmentManager AssetManagement activemanagement activemanager Disclosure bit ly kwUQuk

I am Triple Jabbed and I believe vaccines work and the Covid Vaccines have been extremely helpful and credit to the British People for having the highest uptake of vaccinations in OECD countries But I have serious reservations about mandatory vaccinations I do not support Govt s policy of mandatory NHS vaccination and more importantly the narrative Sajid Javid is pushing in order to force through this policy My reasons are as follows Informed Consent is a core pillar of modern medical ethics It took over years to be developed after analysing through the atrocities of the Holocaust that were specifically committed in the name of medical experiments To undermine informed consent would be to undermine modern medicinal practice Will we be making treatment for mandatory for Hep B and HIV as those pose a huge threat to the public as well This narrative that Sajid Javid has used about unvaccinated staff posing a danger to patients has NO substantial data behind it and he being a politician sat with his media advisors after getting owned by Dr Steve James and came up with this line That interaction was almost the end for his hopes of leading the Conservative Party someday and he had to come out in the media with a counter narrative I have many colleagues who are not vaccinated but are some of the most dedicated healthcare professionals The idea that all these staff are now a danger to patients when they were all a blessing in the first lockdown with no vaccines reeks of hypocrisy I do medicine and politics and my experience in public health has taught me both are intertwined but this narrative is full of pitfalls and can erode public trust in medical staff The above two reasons should be good enough to pause and cancel the introduction of mandatory vaccination irrespective of job profile With the waiting list so long will losing valuable trained and dedicated staff help in any way If we are opening the country up again people then can catch Covid from anyone What is the whole point of making a scapegoat out of Healthcare professionals Could you not get Covid from the cashier at the till or someone serving you at a restaurant or a bar The UK is introducing Paxlovid from February the drug which can reduce hospitalisation and deaths by if infected with Covid Why are we then introducing such draconian measures for NHS staff This govt policy must have a review I know the whole political spectrum is busy with one thing only right now but we must not ignore the ramifications once this policy is implemented I have no problem with an annual Covid vaccine although we must be careful about vaccine fatigue if we introduce weekly vaccines which one company once suggested if i am not mistaken Before any idiot tries to portray me as anti vax I was completely vaccinated according to WHO guidelines while growing up in Bangladesh and before starting for the NHS I had voluntarily got vaccinated with the additional ones I was eligible for at the time as UK has an expanded vaccination programme and for the last years I have diligently taken all my flu vaccines annually I am as pro vaccination as anyone can get but I do not believe in compulsion Pro vaccination should not mean mandatory vaccination If I supported mandatory vaccinations I would have gone to China not the West Please CancelMandatoryVaccination Say NoToMandatoryVaccination

Thursday s huge victory for the Lib Dems in North Shropshire has confirmed that we are on our way back The earlier win in Chesham and Amersham showed that we can win in areas that voted against Brexit But this win is even more significant It shows we can also win in areas that voted Brexit The reason is clear It s the incompetence of the Government the dishonesty the sleaze and the double standards of one rule for us but another the Conservatives It s their sheer sense of privilege they really believe that they re better than us so why should they have to obey the rules More than ever Britain needs liberalism Our children s education must be given a higher priority to make up for the lost years caused by Covid NHS staff and those who work in care homes need a better deal to recognise the hugely important role that they have performed We need a more humane immigration policy If you agree join us today by clicking here Or if you can help deliver our leaflets near where you live email me on andy canning west dorset libdems org uk Yours Cllr Andy Canning

relationships behaviours will end and new chapters finally begin There is the possibility of an Asteroid coming to hit earth this year however this will be detected and there is missiles being fired to break this asteroid up No end of days is being predicted There may be an increase in violence disruption and agendas this year However Spirit is calling on the collective to change that Focus on
