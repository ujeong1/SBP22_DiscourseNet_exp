Those of us with deep roots in the community remember well the problems we had with anti social behaviour in the Morrisons car park area when the store first opened This time it is not the boy racer drivers that are the problem but people using the skate park after dark to create their own sculptures from shopping carts We don t want this to be a tipping point for the old behaviours to return We know Morrisions have deactivated all the tokens on the carts as a Covid reduction measure Understandable Less understandable is the car park left unlocked after trading hours and no real attempt to secure the shopping carts to prevent this type of behaviour Local Labour activists such as the one who took these photos are in the process of contacting Morrisons to see what can be done to address what could develop into more serious issues Local Labour Local Activism

During this year s Living Wage Week the local branch of UNISON the public service union is calling for a pay rise for hundreds of Portsmouth social care workers Portsmouth City UNISON is calling on employers and funders to boost the pay of care workers to at least the Living Wage of per hour an increase of over a year for the lowest paid Across the country five million people are still paid below the real Living Wage Two thirds of them are women as women dominate careers that are notoriously underpaid and undervalued In the context of cuts to Universal Credit soaring household bills and empty promises of levelling up and a high wage economy the real Living Wage offers an important benchmark Chair of Portsmouth City UNISON branch Jon Woods said Social care workers have put their lives on the line during the covid pandemic delivering highly skilled personal care and support yet they are amongst the lowest paid No wonder there is a crisis in social care when you can be paid more for flipping burgers and pulling pints than for looking after the most vulnerable people in society Social care employers Councils and Central government must step up to the plate to fund and implement the living wage now

CNN Business A rise in global crude oil supply could put the brakes on surging gasoline prices that have hit record levels in parts of the United States and Europe According to the International Energy Agency s latest market report global oil supplies jumped by million barrels per day in October with the United States accounting for half that increase as Gulf of Mexico output recovered from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida in August The Paris based agency said it expected a further boost of million barrels per day over November and December with the United States forecast to provide more of that increase than any other country The world oil market remains tight by all measures but a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon it said Prices for US and Brent crude oil are trading near six week highs at and a barrel That s left drivers in California paying a record per gallon for gasoline according to AAA Europe hasn t escaped either Prices hit record highs in the United Kingdom last month The IEA said it expected output to increase in the next two months despite the OPEC group of oil producing countries declining appeals from US President Joe Biden to ramp up production beyond a planned monthly increment of barrels per day The agency said it had raised its US output forecast by barrels per day for the fourth quarter and by barrels per day on average in as high prices encourage higher output That increase will go some way to meet rising demand still recovering from the Covid slump the report said adding that refinery production was also on the rise again following maintenance over autumn The agency raised its global gasoline demand forecast for the last quarter of by barrels per day after seeing end user demand on track to strengthen further over the rest of the year as more countries open up to international travel people become more mobile and Covid vaccination campaigns pick up

Simple Things Communities of Color Can Do to Protect From Coronavirus
This is not a political post its a post about economics After serving over years in the Senate you d think Joe would have a better understanding of the economics of oil and gas exploration and production and the direct impact on gasoline prices at the pump He is so pro Green everything and so anti oil gas that he has scared off many public and private oil and gas exploration and production companies from investing in new drilling and production even though oil and nat gas prices are high and profitable at the moment So we re going to continue to see less budgeting in the oil and gas companies to find new oil and natural gas to bring to the market Which will lead to less oil and nat gas supplies and increasing demand as we exit Covid and therefore higher prices So expect higher oil and higher natural gas prices and therefore higher gasoline prices in the near future Biden has weaponized his political power and Americans are hurting because of it
SECRET BRITAIN What drives a NHS nurse to do a solid twelve hour shift In the UK one of our biggest assets is the National Health Service The public choose to protect it serve it and nurture it Everyone born and raised in the UK will have utilised the NHS at some point or even just visiting the UK and were unfortunately in need of medical attention NHS nurses are God s angels ready to dispense a much needed joke to ease your discomfort and stress or shield you at your most vulnerable Comforting a child at bed time who is away from their parents for the first time with a cup of hot milk and then marvelling and rejoicing at their recovery When one mature male patient had to have a catheter put in a delicate region his horror was obvious but the NHS nurse had a way of calming him down and getting past his male ego and he was like a little boy again in her professional hands ready to do as she said and quickly eased into a routine Marie Curie Nurses help people living with terminal illness and who want to be cared for and die in the dignity of their own home peacefully They will do daily spot checks and co ordinate times with family members to administer pain relief and medicine It s a tireless affair turning up rain or shine to make sure your patients who rely on you are cared for They don t care if you are a saint or a sinner or even refuse to rally their cause Rich or poor everyone is treated the same under their care and supervision Then of course there was our own Prime Minster Boris Johnson when suffering from Covid it was the NHS nurses who rallied around him and kept an all night and day vigil in his most dangerous hours Try standing for one hour on the same spot let alone an all night vigil it s tiring and hard work What drives such a selfless service of care because they are not paid top dollar they are only making enough to survive and a little more for reasonable extras It s certainly not money or blood ties It s a genuine desire to serve and protect their communities Of course there are other great inspirational stories like the check out girl who must be in her late teens to early s Claire works at a Tesco supermarket and as the familiar beep was sounding off as your items that you can t live without were going down the till she began to look guilty and forlorn It was the first week of the pandemic in March when the whole world was frightened about this unknown disease and had thought there was a potential the world could end All what seems a far away thought now but at the time it seemed very very real because little was known about Covid and the consequences it could herald Claire explained she felt guilty about going to work today The customer was glad she had attended afterall how would they get their lifeline groceries home to feed and sustain themselves Claire explained her Mother had kept crying that morning when she had insisted she call in sick in the first lockdown because she was fearful for her daughter s wellbeing in the face of an unknown virus But Claire insisted she could not let work and customers down but deep down she was scared too Claire was the epitome of grace and strength because she had a beautiful soul that shone like a beacon of light despite her neutral check out uniform Her inner beauty far eclipsed any venerated heiress or celebrity Turning up to work that day was an act of courage despite the emotional turmoil she faced inwards and outwards from her loved ones She is not the only one there is the post man who would wear gloves in the first pandemic frightened to get close to you and would hastily leave your life line of parcels at your door in a hurry once he realised you were aware you had parcels Those parcels meant a lot to people during lockdowns and was the few links to the outside world and we relied more than ever on the network of key workers to keep us going What motivates a NHS Nurse to do a twelve hour shift Often without breaks and little recognition It s a selfless drive discipline and genuine care for the wider community which keeps NHS Nurses serving and without them in our hour of need we would be truly lost without these pillars of the community

Ector County Hospital board voted to comply with a mandate that requires its hospital employees to be vaccinated against Covid or lose millions in federal funding
Medical Center Hospital To Comply With Federal Mandate While several employees rallied and pleaded against the measure Ector County Hospital board voted to comply with a mandate that requires its hospital employees to be vaccinated against Covid or lose millions in federal funding CEO of Medical Center Hospital Russell Tippin stated that roughly of its staff is fully vaccinated and those that are not vaccinated have until January to be fully vaccinated or have an exemption approved by a hospital committee The deadline to file an exemption is November rd less than a week away Tippin stated that he had some plus employees that needed to be vaccinated by the deadline or the hospital could face the possibility of decreasing the number of procedures it schedules to half the normal schedule Federal funding for Medical Center Hospital was also placed in jeopardy recently by a hospital policy The policy drafted more than a year ago instructed hospital employees to place bags over certain Covid patients heads A photo that went viral shows a year old girl wearing a mask with an equipment cover bag over her head and extended down around her waist She can be seen appearing defeated looking down holding an oxygen hose in her hand The girl complained of having trouble breathing for more than minutes but was told the mask and bag had to stay in place The nurse admitted to having forgotten to attach the hose to the oxygen supply The young girl was later admitted to ICU with oxygen levels in the mid s She was instructed to save the bag and reuse it throughout her stay Each time she was taken from her room the bag was placed over her head This has caused her severe anxiety PTSD and shame The year old honor roll student who was very active in school activities found herself unable to tolerate crowds and was forced to withdraw from school The once outgoing teen is now a recluse spending many hours alone in her room The mother stated that she could never have imagined a short term ordeal would cause her daughter such long term anxiety Through support and counseling her mother hopes she will make a full recovery A complaint was filed with the Texas Department of State Health Services

Stand up together and fight back against a system that puts profits over safety Misogyny and sexism is deeply rooted throughout society we need to organise with each other at schools and universities in workplaces and in trade unions for real systemic change Across the UK and over the world domestic violence has been the shadow pandemic to Covid In January alone women in abusive relationships were murdered over one weekend in Merseyside Its s estimated in the UK that women a week are killed by a current or former partner In an economic system where wages are low and welfare is underfunded women and those in abusive relationships essentially become trapped lacking the means to escape and live independently per cent of women say they have experienced sexual harassment A lot of this happens on the street in the form of public street harassment instead of this taken as a serious violation of women s safety women are victim blamed with more importance placed on where they were or what they were wearing rather than why this type of harassment happens and how to end it On top of this hate crimes towards LGBTQ people have quadrupled in years in the month of June there were separate incidents of hate crimes towards the LGBTQ community in Liverpool And now as students return to the city and nightlife venues return to a level of normality not seen in over a year alarmingly there has been rise in drink spiking including spiking by injections Students across the country have organised boycotts against night clubs unless their safety can be assured In the face of all this violence the justice system is not fit to protect women Convictions for rape have continually dropped over the last years in only per cent of cases lead to charges The police cannot be trusted to keep people safe as they often commit violence towards women LGBTQ and people of colour Sarah Everard s murder by serving Met Police officer exposed that there are not just bad apples the whole orchard is rotten The police have put pressure on organisers of previous demonstrations which resulted in their cancellation a demonstration against the rise in spiking and an event to mark the International Day Against VAWG taking advantage of the fear caused by the explosion outside the Women s Hospital and trying to deter women at this time from coming together Merseyside Socialist Alternative oppose this we say we are stronger when we come out together to stand up against misogyny and oppression in all its forms Join us to demand real systemic and socialist change

WHAT THE FACTS TELL US Clearly the massive rapid Pandemic deficit spending resulted in painful levels of inflation America s infrastructure spending has been deficient for decades Our recent last decades record of infrastructure spending has been fraught with red tape waste and costly delays Take California s high speed rail project as an example Removing over regulation and accelerating needed infrastructure modernization will save trillions of dollars and be good for the environment Massive failures like the California example will kill the desire to invest in the future CBO projections of future deficit levels are almost always underestimates when the projection period is longer than years Why Because the CBO by law uses average economic conditions as the basis for their estimates Any period of time that includes a recession demonstrates deficits far in excess of CBO estimates The US has had a major economic downturn about every years for the las years Rapid efficient infrastructure improvement will promote more painful inflation unless it is accompanied by serious deficit reduction in the form of cuts to government spending that doesn t substantially contribute to future economic growth NOW SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE The choice the American people have made for the last years has been to spend money on themselves and not on a better future world for their children This works for the rich who can still buy a decent future for their kids but leaves the children of average Americans in the lurch Each side of our divided political universe possesses some gut instincts that point us in the right direction Trump supporters were correct that we need to remove unnecessary government intrusion into Americans lives As pointed out above only by removing over regulation can we build the America of the future and make America great again But many conservatives are willfully ignorant about past governmental success stories with the exception of those involving the military This blinds them to the potential for making investments in the future that involve the government Progressives are correct that the government can play and has played a critical role in making America a better place Civil rights social security the interstate highway system and basic science research leading to the Covid vaccine massively improved farming techniques and the internet are just a few examples But progressive idealists can also become overly self indulgent and put too much faith in centralized control resulting in massive debt a bloated wasteful overly intrusive government that stifles liberty and economic vitality This is something conservatives point out to their liberal adversaries all the time We all have something to learn from each other Instead of always fighting one another maybe we should pause and consider that no one has all the answers If we listen we may find part of the answer from the people we usually disagree with That is the path to Making America Great Again In the words of my favorite cartoon character We Are Groot
Dear Georgians Day is the day I realized my personal freedoms were in serious jeopardy Since deciding to run for United States Senate here in Georgia that night most Americans have willingly surrendered their personal freedoms hoping for safety provided by government from a virus that poses no serious risk to most Americans They told us not to wear masks Then they told us to wear masks TwoFacedLiars They told us to lock ourselves indoors Then they told us to go outdoors They told us they didn t know anything about the virus They said it was a new virus that definitely came from nature They said that s why the science keeps changing FauciLiedPeopleDied Now we know it definitely came from the Wuhan lab and they have been studying it for years They created it so they knew everything about it CoronaLies So their mask and lockdown orders were lies They knew cloth masks and sending people indoors would help spread the virus FauciTheMonster Many Americans became less healthy intentionally making them more susceptible to serious complications with Covid They waited for vaccines They said don t take the vaccines if they are distributed under Trump NewVaccineTechnology They said if you don t want the vaccine you won t have to inject it into your body Then they said everyone must inject the vaccine no questions asked Shut up and obey or they destroy your life and family VaccineWhip They said it definitely didn t originate from a lab in Wuhan China They banned all talk of the Truth They demanded participation in the MaskLies Most Americans trusted them enough to obey without question They say Trust the Science so as to shut down all critical thought And all the Leaders everywhere obeyed without question This is why I m running for United States Senate in It s why I m recruiting others to run for office FreedomFirst I know how this ends I refuse to bend a knee to Xi Jinping or Fauci That will never happen CancelTheTyrants We are running for office across the country at all levels as Independents who Demand Absolute Truth Love Michael William Fackrell WSWYC GA FackrellforSenate

It ended with a spectacular own goal and its leader showing incredibly bad judgement for the umpteenth time in recent months but I believe privately most National MPs are relieved it ended this way No need for a messy coup and a Game of Thrones style forming alliances to outwit the Lannisters I m surprised Judith lasted this long Her constantly negative strategy with most of her recent gripes seeming to be about easing restrictions a few days earlier all delivered in a bitter Karenesque tone as if she was appealing to the manager of Covid for certainty I think it will be Luxon v Bridges for the top job Mark Mitchell if neither of them want it Luxon mysteriously polls on preferred PM polls despite the fact no one has a clue what he s like as a politician I put this down with the misguided belief many have that successful businessmen are the best equipped people to run a country Maximising profits and cutting costs to appease your shareholders may work in commerce but won t help you maintain hospitals stop the poor from either starving or running riot or giving the next generation a chance of a decent future Bridges has been leader before of course He s smart but gaffe prone and has had his own lapses in judgement such as his infamous social media rant I think Simon will win

On the fence about committing to a volunteer program Here s some advice from IVHQer If you are debating whether or not to volunteer take this as a sign and do it I promise you won t regret it Back in March before the pandemic I was living in Spain and was supposed to volunteer in South Africa but because of Covid I couldn t go This year now that I m back in Mexico I was thinking which destination I could go to I saw Peru on IVHQ s website and knew barely anything about it just that they had another Wonder of the World Machu Picchu Being in the Childcare program was a unique experience I was placed in a tiny town north if Cusco It s so small that even Peruvians in Cusco had not heard of it The children in the town were so excited to have a teacher most of them hadn t gone to school since March before the pandemic hit Outside of volunteering I made great friends and so many unique memories plus there s so many different places to visit in Cusco Head to our stories to learn more about volunteering in Peru

Biden Releases Million Barrels of Oil What s Missing November By Sam Madden Biden announced recently that Million Barrels of Oil from the United States Strategic Oil Reserve to combat higher prices at the pump Will this have an effect on gas prices for the consumer Also is there anything missing in this equation that the media or the Biden Administration is not taking into consideration In the U S consumed nearly Million Barrels a day which has only been increasing in as Covid restrictions have been loosened and Americans are traveling more So this release of Oil from the Strategic Reserve is less than days with of oil consumption by consumers in the United States This has been pointed out by many saying that this small supply of oil will have little effect on prices at the pump What is missing is that the U S will be selling oil at a wholesale price of approximately per Barrel This comes to Trillion into the Government s Coffers So it s not a bad time to release this oil that is sitting idle while our Government continues to run a deficit Ideally when the Biden Administration replenishes the oil that is sold into the market the price will be lower than when the U S Government buys it back And if they plan their purchases properly just as a prudent investor in the stock market would they would not buy it all at once but in little pieces so as not to drive up the price Sources Sam Madden is a Free Lance Writer and Research Professional at He can be reached at samuel madden yahoo com or on Twitter

Nevada Appeal will not publish my letter to editor Clinton Slaughterhouse Bagwell At the closing of the Board meeting on the September th mayor Bagwell you stated that the individual even this morning while he thinks we have no public comment he manages to be here every meeting making public comments so I just want to put that on the record that it just isn t so This is an outright lie I was the only male that addressed the Board that morning So the He your referencing mayor can only be me I never stated there is no public comment Mayor you said regarding public comment on agenda items I might be willing to consider that at a point I have chosen not to do so for this reason we are under a covid restriction whether we agree with it or not it does not matter That statement reminds me of a Bill Clinton statement I did not have sexual relations with that woman Both statements are political BS Mayor your mandate of restricting public comments on agenda items due to the covid is nothing more than a scheme to silent citizens We are living in a time where politicians are using covid to their advantage and this is most certainly the case with the mayor The slaughterhouse agenda comes to the Board in November Citizens will only be allowed to speak at public comment for three minutes The slaughterhouse owners have no speaking limits This format totally favors the owners not the citizens This is not the American way Jim Shirk Arizona Circle Carson City NV

Citizens income why it is necessary and how it could be financed In we had David Cameron s big society today we have Boris Johnsons levelling up What we have never really had is a solution to the problem of poverty that has any more substance to it than a sound bite Our Benefits system is designed to be as difficult to use as possible forcing the unemployed and disabled into low wage jobs Things are now so bad that I keep expecting a statement from Priti Patel announcing the return of the workhouse Philip Alston the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights in his final report for the United Nations has said that Poverty is a Political Choice That is certainly true in a country as wealthy as ours There seems to be no shortage of money The Bank of England has printed trillion over the last year in a quantitative easing QE stimulus package Where the problem lies is in the distribution and entitlement to all the wealth What real solutions are there available to us to end the poverty trap that so many find themselves in today We propose as one of the cornerstones of our progressive policies a Citizens Income This would be paid to all UK citizens regardless of their employment status putting an end to the benefits system state pensions family allowance sickness benefits and food banks Children s legal guardians would receive the child s CI on their behalf up until the age of All real poverty in society would finally be alleviated This would end unemployment as it is perceived today and retirement could be at the discretion of the individual CI itself will not be taxed and all income over and above CI being taxed at the same flat rate Having CI enables everyone to live at a basic level without the worry of becoming destitute through a lack of funds The financial stability that CI brings would take the unnecessary stress out of everyday living helping both families and individuals to fulfil their lives more productively An augmented Citizen s Income ACI would be paid to those with disabilities It will not be means tested Also in recognition of their long years of service a Seniority Supplement for all voters over the age of sixty five will also be made CI is basically a dividend as we are all shareholders in UK PLC All well and good except that the amount of money this would cost is astronomical So how could it be financed If CI was a year for each adult and for each child the cost of CI would equal that of the total annual tax revenue that the government currency receives The Green party has a similar policy in their manifest that they would fund with a Carbon Tax They do not however give an estimate as to how much extra revenue a Carbon Tax would bring Whatever the amount such a tax would raise it could never be enough to finance a Citizens Income for all So an alternative way of funding CI needs to be found other than creating a new tax or expecting general taxation on its own to be sufficient What is money and where does it come from We come here to an interesting question what actually is money and where does it come from If you do not already know you may be surprised by the answer Only about of money currently in circulation comes from the Bank of England These are the coins and notes that we use that are made by the royal mint The rest comes from debt and is made electronically by the banks when we borrow from them If you use your bank overdraft or credit card take out a personal loan or mortgage the credit that your bank extends to you is all new money When Theresa May told the nurses that there was no magic money tree she was not being truthful In fact all our money comes from the magic tree i e it comes out of nowhere When we pay it back into our account the money that we have borrowed just disappears again All that is left is the interest that our bank charges us A drawback with this system is that the Central Bank and the Government have little control over the money in the economy So when things occasionally go wrong it can be costly to rectify the problem The last economic crash is an example of this Mostly caused by deregulation because past governments had decided that growth was more important than stability George Osbourn when he became the Chancellor of the Exchequer decided to pay back the government borrowing that resulted from the bailout with an austerity program of reduced spending Coupled with a tax cut for the rich to help stimulate growth This was totally wrong thinking the more governments spend the greater their income because it is their spending that stimulates economic growth Therefore the bailout in the end cost us more than was necessary QE has been used in the past to put money into the economy when the banks have stopped lending The problem with QE is that it puts money into the markets when in fact it is most needed at the lower end of the economic spectrum Another idea for solving this kind of liquidity trap is called a helicopter drop Putting a lot of cash into the economy by Central Banks making payments directly to individuals This has so far never been tried and is like QE a quick fix as opposed to a long term strategy for maintaining a stable economy Direct monetary financing The Governments overdraft facility with the bank of England is a form of direct monetary financing Instead of financing the Government indirectly with QE the Bank of England is now financing them directly This has given them unlimited funds to fight Covid But so far they have made no new Fiscal Policy that takes into account the possible ramifications of having unlimited credit A new idea that is being looked at by the worlds governments and central banks is Central bank digital currency CBDC We are all aware of Bitcoin and other digital currencies The difference between those and a CBDC is that a digital currency made by a central bank would be guaranteed by them So in your central bank digital account would always be worth the same as a note in your wallet Everyone having a CBDC account would give the Bank of England the ability to helicopter drop money directly into the economy if liquidity had become a problem and the economy was stagnating CBDC accounts however could alternatively be used as a way of paying CI to all citizens Without undermining the role that the banks play in generating credit and being a safe place for savings and for making bill payments What are the dangers Putting too much new money into the economy can devalue the pound and cause inflation This is where taxation comes in Taxation is the most affected way of removing surplus cash from the economy Setting tax rates at the right level as well as interest rates can keep the currency stabilised With the added ability to put more money in should it be needed Giving far more control over the economy than is currently possible Five small countries already have a CBDC St Kitts and Nevis Antigua and Barbuda St Lucia Grenada and the Bahama s We should not expect it to be long before larger economies such as ours do the same thing Why not use this opportunity to create a Citizens Income for all and end poverty for good Philip Notley progressiveeuropeanparty gmail com

The first evidence of civilisation was identified by anthropologist Margaret Mead as a broken femur which had healed She argued this was the earliest proof that someone had taken the time to care for someone else who d been injured This doesn t happen in the animal world you break a leg and you die and the bone never gets time to heal But this bone had healed which meant that the person was protected while vulnerable and fed and cared for That for her was the start of civilisation The thing that separates us from animals So you have have to ask the question if we don t care for others if we don t feed them if we don t take them in and give them shelter what does that say about us as humans When we trap migrants at borders force them to find illegal help to cross seas cut aid close borders slash benefits or keep all the covid vaccines for ourselves what does that say about modern civilisation

When I first came to UK I had to take clearance exams to become a registered doctor in UK along with a language exam two exams that only non EU doctors have to take racism I also did a Masters from Barts in Public Health and during those phases I was introduced with a cornerstone of UK and EU medical ethics called Informed Patient Consent Choice IPC Now let me make absolutely clear if you are offered the vaccine you should take it I have seen mortality and morbidity due to Covid and I will always ADVISE taking the vaccine But I DO NOT support a vaccine mandate IPC is an essential pillar of General Medical Council and EU Medical Council and it is a novel Western concept that took ages to develop after the horrors of the medical experiments that were carried out during the holocaust and by Japanese scientists in China Korea and Philipines The way countries like Germany Austria Netherlands and other EU countries are mandating vaccines is an affront to IPC amd undermines the most enlightened medical ethics in the st century It is also opening up a can of worms in the field of medical ethics Will HIV and Hepatitis B treatments be made mandatory in future as they have the chance of mass spread in multiple ways Where do we draw the line In the end all I can hope is the UK govt refrains from further lockdowns and do not impose a vaccine mandate Photo Credit The Daily Mail and Sky

Treasure Island Toll Updates From Thanks Jim Steve TI Wine Our intervention at the Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency TIMMA Committee meeting Nov yielded some significant results Apologies for the length but there is much to report For starters we objected to the narrow definition of what businesses qualify for toll subsidies Under food services and distribution only the two island restaurants and the two grocery stores qualified Many non profit organizations on the island didn t qualify because subsidies were available only to employees and many of these groups are staffed by volunteers or depend on either members or clients that come to the island regularly to sustain themselves Wineries and distilleries don t qualify because they don t serve food We pointed out that island businesses did not have an opportunity to have input into these rules even though we asked staff for months to define the parameters of which food service businesses and nonprofits would qualify for subsidies Although TIMMA staff acknowledged they were unaware of the different staffing models used on the island and that this information required further thought and discussion they were unable to give us the details saying they would get back to us with them But the proposal went before the TIMMA Committee a few days later for a vote without our getting the information we had been promised In the Committee discussion that followed Supervisor Matt Haney chair of the committee and the district supervisor for Treasure Island said he didn t understand how long term businesses could be left out of the subsidies and questioned the criteria for inclusion in the program Staff informed Haney that the decision was based on Treasure Island Development Agency TIDA guidance that only resident serving businesses qualified Haney said every time he d been to the island s wineries and distilleries he saw residents there I m not sure I support that approach he said indicating that the policy needed to be revisited That may give our business members another chance to qualify for the subsidies Transit Affordability Staff also presented new affordability proposals to the committee New percent discounts will be instituted for all future moderate and low income travelers to the island That means all future residents and employees of island businesses as well as visitors and customers whose income falls into those categories will qualify This new policy includes complete exemptions for those who qualify as very low income One will have to apply for the income based discounts through a yet to be developed FastTrak program Proof of having qualified for below market rate housing the PUC Care program or Muni Life Line will automatically qualify you for the discounts Otherwise you will have to prove your income status You will have to verify your income every two years to continue the discount In addition staff proposed instituting TI transit passes month and affordability passes for month that will be good for unlimited use on tolls and ferries Note that all the affordability exceptions and programs have been responses to three years of the TIOC constantly hammering that the toll is making the island unaffordable for the low and moderate residents the development was intended to serve and also threatened the survival of the businesses on TI Perhaps most important have been the unanimous calls for No toll coming from residents and businesses Our successes include the resident exemption the subsidies for non profits and food businesses and discounts on the tolls and ferries Ferries Staff announced that a ferry will begin running to San Francisco starting this January The incentive for this new plan did not come about out of some concern for the current residents but because the developers have started selling the market rate read luxury condos on Yerba Buena Island and the ferries are part of the sales enticements The developers will subsidize the cost of the ferries leaving a fare each way to ride until the development s ferry system is up and running in The developer ferry will run every minutes and every minutes during peak times The money the developers will spend on their ferry over the next two years before the project s ferry service begins in will be in addition to the funds they are committed by the Development Agreement to spend on transit infrastructure Board Sailors the Law and the Toll Several members of the San Francisco Board Sailing Association spoke at the meeting The SFBSA advocates for Windsurfers and Kiteboarders Boardsailors to have unrestricted access to San Francisco Bay to create and improve boardsailing launch sites and facilities and to promote and enhance boardsailing safety SFBSA members pointed out that the toll obstructed the public s access to public waterways for recreation Several state laws case law the development s Final EIR the agreement between the City and County of San Francisco and the State Lands Commission and even the legislation AB granting the right to charge a toll on Treasure Island all guarantee that recreational public access right When Supervisor Haney asked staff how the city should deal with the public access issue staff responded that the board sailors could simply pay the new low income version of the toll But nothing in the laws or agreements suggest that public access is dependent on payment of any fees In fact they explicitly are meant to encourage not discourage access and use of these public lands SFBSA members pointed out On Monday Nov the Bay Conservation and Development Commission BCDC the state agency tasked with and empowered to regulate development along the bay s shoreline including Treasure Island s sent TIMMA a letter saying its plan to charge a toll for non resident visitors to TI appears to violate the agreement the city made with BCDC and the permit that authorized the construction That discrepancy could require a review the BCDC said This issue may come up at the Wednesday Nov community outreach meeting Meeting details below All this begs the question Why hasn t the TIMMA planning staff or the City Attorney s office ever addressed this glaring legal liability And how will the FasTrak tolling transponders distinguish which cars carry the hundreds of water and other recreational visitors to the island Another related question How will that toll system deal with HOV vehicles that the toll s enabling legislation AB requires have free access to Treasure Island Moreover how could this project be so far along and behind schedule without someone in the City s legal department having researched and read the laws and policies governing the development Union Crews Since the documents provided for the hearing made no mention of it we asked if the plans for the ferry included using union crews Not only is it the right thing to do to provide jobs with good wages health and retirement benefits the Inlandboatmen s Union ferry workers at ports all throughout the US and Canadian Pacific Coast ports are trained and licensed Able Bodied Seamen experts on safety on the water We were reassured they would have the ferry jobs TI transportation program costs TIOC member Jim Mirowski thanked the TIMMA staff for finally providing some of the financial numbers we have been requesting for some two years But in the presented high level budget for the first five years of the tolls and transportation costs there was little in supporting assumptions no details on traffic patterns toll revenues were not explained and it contained little in the way of cost details on many of the important aspects of the program Mirowski noted that from their own numbers Total program costs for first five years M Shortfalls even with Developer subsidies M Total Cost for the Ferry Shuttle On call Bus to Oakland M Mirowski asked why TIMMA is spending M for the toll program when the incremental total transportation only cost M for the first five years Even with some Federal funding that leaves a shortfall that would require the developer to burn through the remainder of its subsidy fund to cover it He suggested pushing back the implementation of the toll until and subsidize the ferry and bus until In short it would be less cost and could encourage ferry use During Public Comment Mirowski encouraged the Board of Supervisors and TIDA board members to watch the videos of the outreach meetings to witness the level of frustration as fundamental questions the community has been asking for a long time are either ignored or never answered Issues ranged from a lack of an economic impact study updated post Covid traffic forecasts and which businesses qualify for the proposed subsidies to questions regarding the surveys of residents Many of the issues may be larger than the specifics of transportation planning but without the background the community cannot reasonably comment on the proposed toll Most of the project s assumptions were done in and and the world has changed he said We need to stop looking at the project through the soda straw of transportation planning and understand what the economic impact of the toll will be on Treasure Island businesses and the community

In January of I scared many of you with an incoming Covid pandemic that would lock up the world and change our lives Now I m here to tell you that the pandemic will end in the next few weeks I don t have a crystal ball but just watch what happens in other countries Italy led our knowledge into the pandemic South Africa is telling us what will happen next Someone is South Africa got Covid and one of the coronaviruses that cause the common cold at once Both viruses invaded the same cell at the same time and their genetics got mixed up Sort of like Covid got the cold The new virus now known as Omicron has part of SARS CoV and part of the routine cold virus It became much more infectious Within weeks of Delta infections have been replaced by Omicron and in the next couple of weeks almost all Covid will be Omicron Nasty Delta will be gone This rapid shift is now happening all over the world Why is this fantastic news Omicron is like the common cold less than the flu even People get a little sick with almost no hospitalizations and no deaths and no oxygen requirements no intubations There is a slight uptick of people in hospitalized patients with Omicron but they are not there because of the virus they just happen to have the virus when tested People who have had vaccines are protected People who have had Covid are protected Both vaccinated and previously Covid positive people can still get Omicron but nobody dies gets hospitalized or requires oxygen Because this virus is infecting everyone it meets the whole world will get it within the next few weeks and before March the pandemic will be over I still recommend all people over even with no health problems or anyone under with medical conditions get your boosters In light of this information I pray that our politicians don t do anything crazy like shutting down businesses or schools and remove the vaccine mandates which hurt businesses and people who need to work and our children in school Also remove the vaccine mandate for children We will soon put this pandemic behind us and get back to glorious life Much love

BORIS JOHNSON TRIES TO DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE It s a telling observation that not one of Boris Johnson s ministers has been willing to publicly defend or even describe the so called Government s position on the Christmas Party in No last year It is after all indefensible This laughing in the face of the British public exposes the real character of Boris Johnson s vanity Government The claim from the Prime Minister and his ministers has unsurprisingly been that it is their top priority to make certain lives are saved But this latest revelation goes to show that it s easy to make such a claim not so easy to stick to their own rules It takes a moral compass and talent to make good on a promise So let me remind you what we were told around the time this infamous gathering was obviously taking place Johnson was announcing that the planned relaxation of restrictions for up to three households to form a Christmas bubble was being reduced from five days to Christmas Day only This meant that friends and families could only meet on Christmas Day rather than from the period in December as had been previously announced Meanwhile the NHS was flat out while members of Downing Street s elite were apparently taking part in illegal revelry Indeed on that Friday in December there was desperation in many hospital corridors Doctors and nurses were in the middle of a repeat of Covid s first wave earlier in the year The infection rates per people in Rochdale had increased by more than in the seven days leading up to December Pandemic casualties were threatening to overwhelm available wards and overcrowded ICUs Patients were struggling as NHS staff scrambled to find iPads and other equipment so they could be connected to their families who after all were not allowed to visit in person Throughout the country people were dying because ventilators had to be rationed Doctors and nurses described it as being like applying field medicine of a most brutal kind On December we are now being told that members of this Tory government and its advisers were nibbling cheese and quaffing champagne while NHS staffs were tackling the symptoms of those people too weak to have any chance of surviving Covid These included older people and those who needed to be immunosuppressed because of their underlying health conditions It was not as if at the end of last year this was a new phenomenon We had witnessed this horror earlier in the year too But instead of listening to his scientific advisers who had warned of the importance of winter restrictions Johnson hadn t been able to resist the cheap populism of being seen as the one who saved Christmas In fact on December the Covid death toll had reached Just two months later on February it reached Johnson s vanity government effectively cost the country more than deaths from Covid alone in that period It s not good enough and even today they are floundering about playing games with our lives

Market Highlight December th The emergence of the new Omicron coronavirus variant along with a hawkish pivot by the Federal Reserve Fed kicked off a period of elevated market volatility the past couple of weeks Fortunately the economy has strong momentum in terms of both real and nominal growth heading into any potential Omicron slowdown As for the Fed in an appearance before Congress Jay Powell acknowledged inflation has been higher and more persistent than expected effectively retiring the term transitory and raised concern that Omicron has the potential to exacerbate inflationary pressures further As such he signaled that the Fed would likely turn its attention away from supporting the economy towards fighting inflation beginning with an accelerated tapering of its bond buying program beginning this month This pivot should not be viewed as risk friendly for the markets particularly for the highly valued speculative stocks that previously benefited from low volatility and extraordinary liquidity There is a clear disconnect at present between strong economic growth high rates of inflation and the Federal Funds rate at The Fed s emergency liquidity measures should have ended long ago and will now be more difficult and painful to correct We believe there are a number of favorable growth drivers that should help us rebound from any Omicron slowdown including global reopening a housing rebound an auto rebound and inventory replenishment The US consumer remains in great shape excess savings and record high net worth and in position to power the economy ahead as confidence recovers We continue to actively monitor risks such as margin pressures caused by rising input costs an inflationary wage price spiral that forces the Fed to act sooner and more forcefully than expected new Big Tech regulatory or legislative constraints geopolitical conflicts Russia Ukraine China Taiwan and additional Covid disruptions that could once again impede the recovery READ THE FULL REPORT InvestmentStrategies AtlantaGA Fiduciary RIA InvestmentManagement PortfolioManagement RiskManagement Investing InvestmentAdviser AssetAllocation WealthManagement AssetManager InvestmentManager AssetManagement activemanagement activemanager Disclosure bit ly kwUQuk

Thursday s huge victory for the Lib Dems in North Shropshire has confirmed that we are on our way back The earlier win in Chesham and Amersham showed that we can win in areas that voted against Brexit But this win is even more significant It shows we can also win in areas that voted Brexit The reason is clear It s the incompetence of the Government the dishonesty the sleaze and the double standards of one rule for us but another the Conservatives It s their sheer sense of privilege they really believe that they re better than us so why should they have to obey the rules More than ever Britain needs liberalism Our children s education must be given a higher priority to make up for the lost years caused by Covid NHS staff and those who work in care homes need a better deal to recognise the hugely important role that they have performed We need a more humane immigration policy If you agree join us today by clicking here Or if you can help deliver our leaflets near where you live email me on andy canning west dorset libdems org uk Yours Cllr Andy Canning

Years ago when I first started working in a private practice setting I had strong ideas about a few issues I wasn t going to work with For one no domestic violence I envisioned angry violent abusers finding their way into my office and I was definitely not going to put myself in those kinds of unsafe circumstances What I soon found out however is that the new client who comes to therapy with symptoms of depression or anxiety or unspecified life stressors may only later disclose violence within a relationship Or more commonly a feeling that something in that relationship just doesn t feel right And while abusers sadly have at times attacked therapists they are more likely to enter the therapist s office as the concerned involved overly attentive spouse or partner at least at first And so I came to work with people dealing with domestic violence Because ready or not they found me And because there was a need I also wasn t going to work too much with trauma I thought I was much better suited to help people with symptoms of depression or anxiety or family issues Until people walked into my office with those types of complaints and proceeded to disclose all of their trauma Or more commonly to describe the overwhelming anxiety that started after a certain experience that they may not have even processed as traumatic I soon found myself searching for trauma focused continuing education and certifications as I laughed at my own naivete If only trauma could be checked off in a neat little box on an intake form Similarly I wasn t looking to focus too much on grief I actually enjoyed doing grief work with people but I didn t envision a large percentage of my working hours being focused on something that could also be emotionally draining But again people who came in with other issues soon shared the grief they were feeling over lost loved ones and lost relationships and lost opportunities I wondered how I ever thought I could limit how much I focused on grief And then came Covid which brought with it more grief and more trauma and yes also more domestic violence as well as addiction and social isolation And those things are currently the focus of most of my work Not because I sought to be a trauma therapist or a grief therapist or someone who specializes in domestic violence but because as therapists we are trained to meet people where they are And right now this is where people are Please don t be afraid to reach out if you or a loved one is struggling We will meet you where you are or find someone who can

Warning to the Vaccine Passport People We will not follow you into captivity You are separating from those of us who value freedom This is a very important moment in Time Pay close attention and think critically You are agreeing to give control over your body to TwoFacedLiars Please take time to do some self reflection Consider how you have changed since the introduction of the Coronavirus into your life Consider all the lies The virus was new definitely from nature It started spreading in December with the first cases in January Fauci knew nothing about it but was absolutely certain it didn t come from the lab Don t wear a mask Then wear a cloth mask Definitely no mandates Definitely back to usual when we have vaccines This is how liars operate You are being deceived by our government They are hurting you They are lying to you Fauci Biden and many other political bureaucrats have been engaged in a full blown Live Lab Test on the American people They re testing a NewVaccineTechnology that was way too dangerous for such widespread use prior to the release of the Coronavirus Our own government has ownership in the Coronavirus vaccine technology It s their baby They birthed their rotten baby on the American people Everything they have done since March when this rotten plan was hatched has been for the express purpose of spreading the virus as much as possible so they could claim success with the vaccines They deployed a lightweight version knowing that herd immunity would be reached quickly and quietly so as to keep people in the dark Then after months of miserable lockdowns that helped spread the virus people were so desperate they would accept their rotten vaccine technology without question They made us miserable so we would happily accept a New Vaccine Technology under Emergency Use Authorization regardless of whether or not we needed it They locked us up and provided their vaccines as a key to our freedom Those who agreed to participate in this lie are not free You are bound by a lie I strongly encourage you to ditch your Vaccine Passport and only wear a mask for honest reasons This is indeed the times warned of in Revelations because this entire thing is based on lies The whole thing The masks are a lie Cloth masks do not protect you from the Coronavirus Everyone wearing a cloth mask for protection from the Coronavirus is wearing a lie That lie is tearing our country apart Most people do not need a vaccine for protection from Covid yet most people are getting it anyway Those who are doing so for the purpose of praise to show others are leading people towards the father of lies You are wearing the mark The mark represents a lie It s Satan s team symbol Wearing a mask for any reason other than the absolute truth is to wear a lie mark Injecting a Coronavirus vaccine into your body because you want to show others while claiming that you are doing it because you honestly believe that you need it is to inject a lie into your body You will know in your heart if you are being honest That s between you and God Mistakes happen Should you find yourself wondering why you got the vaccine or are wearing a mask it s a good time to start asking God to help you find your mistakes Pray for Truth God loves Truth He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword Here is the patience and the faith of the saints Revelation And there followed another angel saying Babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication And the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice If any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name Here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus Revelation Saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing Revelation Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is new Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name Revelation

Today we have one of the more contentious votes in Parliament of the last few years The Government is implementing new measures to try and slow down the spread of the Omicron variant This involves the guidance to work from home where you can extending the use of masks into most non hospitality settings and requiring a lateral flow test to enter larger venues with an exemption for the fully vaccinated While there is much still to learn about the Omicron variant what is clear is that it spreads much more quickly than anything we have seen so far How exactly this will translate into hospitalisations and tragically deaths is something we will come to understand in the weeks and months ahead With infections doubling roughly every two days we will not have long to wait I firmly believe that another lockdown would be devastating for our country especially for children and young people Schools must be kept open and education functioning as our highest priority Many businesses have also been under incredible pressure for much of the last two years and the damage of another lockdown would push many of them over the edge I have spent the last few days going over this with colleagues and Ministers carefully weighing the options available to us and how best to proceed I have been very troubled by the notion of so called vaccine passports My instinct is that they are an affront to British and democratic values and the evidence seems clear that they do not work However I am persuaded that what the Government has come forward with puts the focus on testing with Covid certification as a secondary measure allowing an exemption to testing I will support the Prime Minister in this as there is no compulsion to use them testing is the focus and this seems like a sensible step for high risk venues I would have preferred that testing was the sole element of this policy and I will be urging the Government to drop the use of Covid certification from any future policy decisions Fortunately these are temporary measures that will expire in January of next year when we will have a better idea of what we are facing I am instinctively against further restrictions we must learn to live with this virus We have already felt the dreadful effects of lockdown in lost time with loved ones in lost education and in lost opportunity I fear that there will be more consequences to come as we move into dealing with the legacy of Covid So I will today support the Prime Minister who has led our country through such incredibly challenging times My reservations and concerns persist but I have faith that Boris Johnson will lead us through the darkness as he has before steering a course to recovery once again

sermon on II Peter Let Us Prepare the Way In accordance with God s promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth where righteousness is at home Not to scandalize you but there is a sacrilegious joke I want to tell you Not to shock you but to redeem its punch line The joke which is a riff on end time Christianity goes like this Jesus is coming Look busy It s not a great joke but I think it has a truth that can bless us Jesus is coming Look busy or better yet get busy Get to work doing what Jesus wants us to do to make this world welcome for him and for us all That is what Advent is all about Advent is a season of preparation to make the way ready for the King of kings and Lord of lords If only I was as intentional about doing that as Home Depot is The first Christmas items appeared at Home Depot before Labor Day Go in there today and you ll find the place plastered with poinsettias and home decorations and artificial trees and on and on and on If I was as serious about making Jesus welcome as Home Depot is about making a buck my faith would really move mountains The journalist Nicholas Kristof has an annual column about alternative Christmas giving This year he touted a project called Cure Blindness which offers cataract surgery for poor people in Asia and Africa will restore a person s sight Another organization Campaign for Female Education seeks to get African girls in school and out of child marriages will educate a girl for one year in high school will cover a year of elementary school This program has enabled young African women to get their education and to pay it forward because each graduate mentors and sponsors another girl Talk about changing the world Yes there is only one Savior of the world But by the grace of God it is amazing what we can do to help in that saving work The Youth Service Bureau s Project ReinDEAR the local CASA program sponsoring a child through Compassion International Think of all the wonderful ways we can be about the Lord s work by making things just a little bit more right and good and just and loving See if you can include some alternative Christmas gifts in your gifting this year Instead of another sweater Uncle Harold might really like a Heifer Project duck Cousin Mary might appreciate a gift being given in her name rather than receiving a gift herself Try it and see how that changes the feel and meaning of Christmas for you for good We re in the middle of a pandemic an economic crisis and a poisonous political climate All of that can make us feel pretty powerless After all none of us is going to come up the cure for Covid But we can wear a mask and practice social distancing while we wait for the vaccine to arrive which thankfully is on its way Doing what we can do while we wait is a God given power all of us have And that is what God wants us to do while we wait for God s kingdom to come in full We are to anticipate that reality which only God can bring by doing those things which only we can do As we do what is within our power to do we prepare the way and hasten that day when our Savior fully reigns when righteousness is truly at home when this tired old universe and sin sick world are transformed into a new heavens and a new earth If you think that our power to prepare the way for something that big is just a lot of hype then you have a bunch of geophysicists who will disagree with you During the lock down earlier this year when we all stayed home geologists who monitor tremors and watch for earthquakes reported that the lock down actually decreased the amount of surface tremor for the entire planet Turns out that when billion people do something small it adds up to something that is pretty big Don t underestimate what God can and will do in and through you Your actions have consequences And when you act with God eternally powerful things happen Getting sober Forgiving an enemy Burying a grudge Mentoring a child Living with hope Sharing in love These gospel acts are the basic building blocks of the Kingdom of God So don t just spend this month getting ready for Christmas Get ready for your Savior Welcome him Don t wait passively Do what you can where you are as the Lord leads you As you do you will welcome Christ into your life which shall be blessed and into the world which shall be changed Let us prepare the way In reading this your heart may be stirred What

Congratulations to Albert Bourla Pfizer CEO and one of six finalists for the Genesis Prize on being named the CNN Business CEO of the Year According to CNN Bourla was our choice for all that Pfizer has done in a year where Covid vaccines went mainstream and helped stabilize America s economy and the world s for that matter JewishAchievement
I do not believe in vaccine mandates I think the individual should decide that with the advice of family physicians I am vaccinated because I chose so however mandating vaccinations is illegal and is like forcing people to get an Obedience shot by the government This is dangerous and could open the door to further totalitarian dictates If it was proven that the vaccine is effective in preventing getting Covid or spreading Covid I would feel differently I know of family friends vaccinated unvaccinated who in both cases tested positive for the virus or who died after getting vaccinated Then you have the so called Variants like the Delta and the Omicron variants which complicate confuse the situation even more Add all these factors to the mistrust of the people in big government and bogus Science which changes daily you have major skepticism in the truth major cynicism about the whole thing
Oops people are feeling all too comfortable and the economy and lives are close to getting normal People spent Thanksgiving with family friends retail sales are way up Wow let s ruin that comfort and normalcy by creating a new variant Call it the Omicron for now Let s hide all of the incompetence failures and the stolen election by Biden and team with more Covid scares

Today is International Day of Epidemic Preparedness A good day to talk about vaccines and health equity across the globe Conspiracy theorists and opportunists have created an environment in which many who could have vaccines refuse them At the cost of better universal global health Meanwhile those who are begging for vaccines cannot access them because first world countries haven t reached herd immunity yet and are fighting with said conspiracy theorists An endless cycle of stupidity and tragedy We know we all have areas of stubbornness blind spots hypocrisies All of us But the science and the facts and common sense tell us that getting vaccines saves lives Refusing them is cruel selfish and borderline murderous The ripple effect of each act of individual refusal has become a tsunami look up how many new cases of Covid there were yesterday it s insane covid pandemic epidemicpreparedness ss s accineequity conspiracytheories omicron generations genfilms humanrights

As the Covid pandemic unfolded pro and anti lockdown camps aligned with preexisting political sides The Right generally favors less restrictions and a quicker return to normal while the Left urges more caution while advocating socioeconomic overhaul Many reasons explain the division the pro commerce stance and individualistic ethic on the right the desire to introduce more welfare measures and the emphasis on collective action on the left but the role of religion has been overlooked While Christianity tends to be a stronger force on the right an often unwitting Christianity helped shape the Left s attitude toward Covid

Greg Abbott likes to call himself the CEO of Texas Well if he wants to run Texas like a business then it is up to us to fire him for his incompetence and extremism that is costing Texans their lives It is a failure of leadership that in the energy capital of North America we couldn t guarantee that you could keep the power on or the heat running Dozens of our fellow Texans died because of Greg Abbott s incompetence and yet he hasn t taken any mesures to secure our power grid against winter storms this year But Abbott s negligence doesn t stop there His unwillingness to listen to the science spiked covid cases here leading thousands more losing their lives unnecessarily The level of incompetence and contempt Abbott has demonstrated would warrant any regular worker being fired from his job So why would we let him continue making decisions that endanger our people as our Governor It is up to us to ensure he doesn t have four more years of endangering Texans Chip in right now to help us defeat Greg Abbott

I personally know many family friends who got both shots against Covid Many of them even got the booster shot Yet despite getting the vaccine shots they are sick again in many instances they transmit the virus Firing first aid and health workers fire fighters police any other group of people for not wanting to get vaccinated in the private or public sector is a crime The shots are not a guarantee against getting or transmitting the virus they just are not I personally got the shots because I chose so not because I was forced to It should be an individual choice not mandatory Firing The Marines is beyond criminal It is an injustice a stain on the conscience of all Americans Biden Kamala Harris all the politicians both democrats and republicans should be ashamed for allowing this to happen How do you fire men women in uniform who have always sacrificed life limb for the freedoms of the people and their country How dare you have you no shame no honor no compassion for those who sacrificed their families their spouses their parents their brothers sisters children for us all How from where does your freedom come from who protects those freedoms How dare you fire anyone in service uniforms from health care providers firefighters police National guard and servicemen women Even volunteers who offer aid in times of crises should be revered and honored But soldiers those who serve in the armed forces The top brass military should be ashamed to let this happen What is this country becoming under this senile clown in chief Biden his administration the incompetent people he has chosen to run the country From the House senate to the incompetent Cabinet members to the DOJ district attorneys countrywide the FBI with their misplaced priorities partisan acts God bless all our armed forces men women our police all those in uniforms of service God bless them all The American people shall always remain grateful loyal to those who have served continue serving this country Millions have come are here still millions continue to come to uphold the values of freedom American Exceptionalism Fear not this republic shall always remain Of the People by the people for the People
Everything Biden said about Trump turned out to be a lie He lied about Trump s incredibly professional way of handling Covid and getting the vaccines in warp speed He lied that he would eradicate the virus There have been much more Covid deaths under Biden He lied about unifying the country He lied about enforcing the laws of the land and about being a moderate The man is a hopeless senile pathological liar who was put in office by a totally rigged corrupt election He is being manipulated by his handlers behind the scenes and has no clue how to run anything let alone this country His wife should be ashamed of putting him in such an a position but she likes the power of the position though undeserved embarrassing Every day there is another disaster that occurs worse than the previous day

As we wrap up on let us collectively take a moment to pause and reflect This year has been hard Full of twists and turns Tears and joy We re ready to turn the page on a new year but cautious about what it has in store Looking around Framingham there were many examples of light in the darkness Neighbors helping neighbors with food or finding at home covid tests Keep Framingham Beautiful continues to bring people together to keep our streets and parks clean Veterans Park has undergone an incredible transformation and stands as a wonderful tribute to our veterans We celebrated the opening of the new Fuller Middle School The Framingham Coronavirus Community Outreach partnered with MetroWest Pharmacy to help vaccinate our residents Thank you to all of you for your selfless acts of kindness and love of community Tomorrow our second mayor third Council and third School Committee will be sworn in what an optimistic way to begin a new year We have much more to do to make Framingham a better place for everyone It is my hope for that we put aside the grudges the fights the lies and roll up our sleeves to seize this moment To some the negativity is their playbook for winning The lies they spread and the attitude of doing anything to win are part of the politics of old There should be no room for that in in Framingham We must be better than that as we start this new year together I am ready to stand with you stand with our community and build a Framingham we are proud of for everyone Thank you for your support this year I look forward to seeing the work we can accomplish together in Happy New Year

I was hoping that would start with less smoke and mirrors from our elected officials in Massachusetts unfortunalty once again our legislators from both political parties have failed As our children get ready to return to school and the Omicron variant spreads like wildfire our state legislators took Four Billion dollars of Covid relief money to pet projects instead of protecting our citizens These feckless indivuals like Congressman Jim McGovern and our state legislators from district of Massachusetts forgot to tell their constituents that thousand tests being raced to our public schools does not come close to proper testing Why There are students staff this doesn t count childcare facilities or Universities Bottom line we will run out of rapid test on Monday maybe these jackasses that represent us would like to explain what happens on Tuesday Wednesday and so on Election season is here and accountability is coming yes I m a republican but I will hold all accountable regardless of their party line I made a commitment to my constituents and to all of you that I would tell the truth JSP
I am Kartik Bhatt and I am running to be your next Labor Commissioner I live with my wife Twisha my daughter Namasvi and my parents Harikrishna V Bhatt Hirnaxi H Bhatt in Acworth GA We have been residents of Cobb County since America is a land of opportunity for those who talented and hard working And I am a living breathing example of that This land has provided me and family a wonderful life with plenty of prospects that I look forward to It is my time to give back and serve this nation and all of its citizens particularly the state of state and Georgians who welcomed me with open arms I intend to do that to the best of my ability in steering this office towards truth trust and transparency My journey in the United States had very humble beginnings I landed in USA in August of in pursuit of the American dream A month after we landed here I began working at Publix Supermarket in the Front end Department as a bagger and cart pusher In Jan of I had the opportunity to work as Cashier at Walmart Supercenter In I was blessed to get opportunity to serve at the Cobb County Department of Public Safety as an animal control officer Life took a turn when my family entered real estate business in And of the most significant roles of my career was the honor and opportunity provided by our Honorable Governor Brian Kemp to serve on the Board of Examiners for the Certification of Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators and Laboratory Analysts and I have been committed completely to serving the people of this peach state In I had the opportunity to be the first Indian American Honorary Driver at the US President Motorcade WHY IAM RUNNING FOR OFFICE I am a Conservative Public Servant and not a carrier politician I am running for Labor Commissioner inspired by India s philosopher and author of political treatise Arthashastra Archarya Chanakya who urged the youth to join politics instead of complaining about what is not right for the country to clean up the system MY GOALS AND PLANS My main goal is to ensure that hardworking Georgians are financially independent I believe this is the right time to safeguard the future and it begins with each and every employee of each and every company My goal is to create a plan that engages excites and empowers the labor force to perform better and contribute to their companies which will further contribute to the growth and prosperity of the state My first step includes restoring broken relationships and building trust between my Office and hardworking Georgians Towards this end I will create a Community Engagement Team which will engage the community and the issues and address them appropriately I truly believe that good leadership happens not by instruction but by inspiration Along with my team I will also get involved personally I encourage one on one meeting with me one person a week to meet me at my office for to min without an appointment I believe that we all are children of God and are therefore family in the truest sense no matter our Race or Ethnicity Every months I plan to host a Multicultural Community meeting to connect with Georgia leaders from various cultural and ethnic backgrounds The Goal is to discuss how we can all work together with Integrity to foster innovations and invest in the state of Georgia As someone who started their career as a cart pusher I can relate to

my first days in office Here will be a Special Committee created for this purpose I already spoke with to State legislators What is Extra charge The charge was passed in March as part of Georgia House Bill The Hotel Occupancy Tax which charges guests an extra per night no matter what the rate of the Hotel Room Unfortunately this New Tax was created in the late night with no opportunity for citizen or industry to chime in You can see other states don t have extra charge so why only Georgia All the fees and Taxes add up for guests budgeting for an extra Per Night BOUNCE BACK GEORGIA I understand that termination layoffs in some cases set people on either path or grief or crime My office will always be open for you We will help you with benefits and also help in your next job search so we can

Safety Security CUSTOMER SERVICE My main focus is Customer Service As a Labor Commissioner I will hire more staff to receive calls and emails I will introduce a call center and we will answer calls I will take care of my employees respect them try to provide the best facilities and treat them like family best training updated technology I believe Leadership Attracts Loyalty Commitment I will take care of my employees so they can provide friendly and generous reception service for our citizens AGRICULTURAL H A Program I spoke to approximately to Farmers They shared their struggles with lack of manpower labor shortage As Labor Commissioner I will create Agricultural workforce Development Program through the Technical college system of Georgia to train future farmers and Agri Business Leaders I will be part of the Georgia Grown campaign I will offer international help to Georgia Farmers and Agri Business to take their products to the global market If farmers want more labor then I will start an H A Program The H A Program allows U S employers who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs I already spoke with some Immigration attorneys about what way we can help our Georgian Farmers ELECTION INTEGRITY If our SOS wanted extra help for Election Integrity I will definitely help them secure our election

Not often but every once in a while God brings us to a major turning point a great crossroads in our life From that point we either go toward a more and more slow lazy and useless Christian life or we become more and more on fire giving our utmost for His highest our best for His glory Oswald Chambers At the end of I saw posts on social media where people were relieved that was over Surely would be better Covid would go away everyone would get along again and we d get back to normal On January the US capitol was breached Covid like a hydra keeps growing new heads Racial tensions continue to simmer The murder rate in the US increased in as compared to Sexual depravity is the norm The occult is mainstream Two days ago I visited a Barnes and Noble A mother and her teenage daughter were standing next to the occult book section near the main aisle The daughter was arguing with her mother because she wanted to buy a book of spells so she could learn to talk to spirits Thankfully her mom responded with No you don t need that But chances are high that her daughter has been exposed to the occult prior to visiting Barnes and Noble If Mom isn t a believer and can t explain to her daughter why flirting with the occult is dangerous her daughter may eventually get what she wants Youth and adults continue to exit the church Last summer a guy started a website offering a program on how to walk away from the faith Every day the news has stories of church leaders exposed for sexual sin arrogance or spiritual abuse The porn epidemic in the church continues to rage nearly unabated In most churches you won t hear a word about the above Sunday morning The faithful stroll into church Starbucks coffee cups in hand Back to our verse by verse study in Corinthians on spiritual gifts The worship band really rocked it today Hey what s for lunch Zzzzzzzz My family and I spent much of visiting churches of all sizes looking for a new home church we moved to Arizona in Most of the church websites I looked at said Come as you are We didn t hear You can t stay as you are or about the narrow road that leads to life that few find Mathew They want everyone to feel comfortable which is a part of the problem I m not talking about chairs The pastor of one church we visited apologized for giving a message on depression because it wasn t a pleasant topic Another church played secular music immediately after their service The pastor at another church based his sermons on The Chosen and was encouraging the flock to watch that week s episode No wonder people are walking away from the faith churches like this are just another entertainment option I had hoped to find a church that spent time praying Sunday mornings Forget it Gonna have to start a home church if I want that Whatever happened to being devoted to teaching fellowship and prayer Acts confronting the church over its sexual sin as Jesus told us to do in Revelations and challenging people to go all out with God Maybe watching The Chosen will give me the answers I m not knocking the program but we have to discern between Cultural Christianity Christian entertainment and actually doing what has impact and is commanded in Scripture Or maybe I ll leave the TV off and go rogue by spending at least an hour every day in prayer cultivate a passionate love relationship with the Lord and focus on doing what God s word says to do instead of merely studying it Our team at Blazing Grace will continue to expose the sexual sin in the church and offer healing and freedom for those who want it And I ll focus on making my brief life count for eternity and encourage others to do the same Later this month my next book will be released The Way of the Rogue Christian Living a Life that Counts for Eternity The book will challenge and equip you and your church to live a life of spiritual impact and significance More on the book in the weeks ahead will be the year of the Rogue Christian We live in dark times that are getting darker Lukewarm believers will either fade away or they ll keep playing church as long as they don t get offended or forced out of their comfort bubble Then they ll look for another entertainment option oops I mean church Those who aren t playing games with sin or God are the ones who will be tough enough to endure to the end no matter what happens It is the Rogue Christians the doers of the word who are willing to go all the way with God who will make their lives count for eternity And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray And because lawlessness will be increased the love of many will grow cold But the one who endures to the end will be saved Matthew I will leave you with this We see a lot of men who are playing games with pornography and sexual sin They re destroying themselves their marriages their families If this is you please don t wait a day longer Get help now Don t waste your life on the pathetic love counterfeit of lust

The Tories ended with their corruption and hypocrisy exposed While millions of people faced lockdown restrictions last winter and were forced to spend Christmas alone or watching loved ones die the Tories and their friends partied on After two years of Tory crony contracts millions are acutely aware that lies corruption and cover ups are at the heart of the system But the attacks on working people keep coming begins with the Covid variant Omicron sweeping the country Boris Johnson is not bringing in new measures to protect public health because he puts profits before people thus ensuring more pressure will be piled on the NHS While billionaires thrive and capitalists enrich themselves as the pandemic rages workers face rocketing prices particularly in energy Faced with multiple crises the Tories answer is to divide and rule with racism and to repress dissent with more authoritarianism Meanwhile Keir Starmer s Labour Party continues to move to the right looking to repeat Tony Blair s New Labour This comes as millions are disgusted that the war criminal Blair was awarded a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter in the New Year s Honours list But showed that the working class can fight back and win A rash of strikes has taken place including locally on the bins in Derbyshire amongst JustEat delivery drivers and B Q warehouse workers We will need more of such struggles and on a bigger scale if we are to smash the Tories in We have also seen mass resistance on the streets against climate catastrophe racism and attacks on LGBTQI people Come along to our meeting which will report back on discussions at the SWP s National Conference which takes place in early January to discuss how we can build resistance to the Tories and their corrupt system See less

Monthly Market Summary A high level look at factors impacting the financial market The U S equity market finished the year on a strong note as the S P Index gained in December Defensive issues led the way as concerns and uncertainty regarding the Omicron variant caused investors to consider a possible slowing of economic activity Consumer Staples Real Estate and Health Care were the leading sectors while Consumer Discretionary was the worst performing sector Large and mid cap stocks outperformed small caps and value outperformed growth across all market cap ranges The Omicron variant is spreading rapidly leading to spiking case counts but very low fatalities The South African experience suggests it should flame out quickly Widespread lockdowns are unlikely however consumer caution will likely temper growth and extend supply chain disruptions similar to Delta The economy has strong momentum and should be able to absorb another Covid slowdown Persistent red hot inflation a function of too much demand extraordinary monetary fiscal stimulus and too little supply Covid impact has forced the Federal Reserve s Fed hand to an accelerated taper of bond purchases and three possible rate hikes in While monetary policy remains highly accommodative the Fed pivot to fighting inflation is not risk friendly Positive growth drivers in include a global reopening b housing and auto rebound and c inventory replenishment In addition the US consumer remains in great shape and in a position to power the economy forward as confidence recovers S P earnings estimates have continued to move higher boosted by strong nominal growth pricing power and productivity gains however Q Q estimates could get revised lower in the near term due to Omicron We continue to believe a balance of high quality cyclical and secular growth stocks is appropriate at this time given the many uncertainties related to Covid fiscal and monetary policy and bond yields We remain highly convicted in those stocks whose positions were strengthened as a result of this pandemic and are therefore poised to perform well as the economy fully reopens and returns to a more normal state These stocks remain reasonably priced and are expected to deliver above average profit growth in the year ahead REPORT InvestmentStrategies AtlantaGA Fiduciary RIA InvestmentManagement PortfolioManagement RiskManagement Investing InvestmentAdviser AssetAllocation WealthManagement AssetManager InvestmentManager AssetManagement activemanagement activemanager Disclosure bit ly kwUQuk

I ve tried to consistently provide unpoliticized facts about Covid that rely on our local stats here in Garland rather than far away orgs with acronyms Among Garland residents who have died from Covid not just with Covid since Feb when nd dose vaccinations first became possible only were vaccinated A full of the Covid fatalities in Garland since then have been unvaccinated residents Parkland reported earlier this week that of their recent Covid deaths have been unvaccinated I ve lost several unvaccinated friends whom I loved and respected the most recent on New Years Day They had largely judged by the experiences of their friends many of whom had contracted Covid and been okay Unfortunately they failed to understand that Covid hits different people in different ways They gambled and lost The tragedy is that they didn t understand that they were playing a form of Russian Roulette with an unpredictable virus The fatality stats are what they are They aren t imaginary numbers being manipulated by political players they are right here in our own neighborhoods with names and faces and families I ve shared here before that I m a devotee of natural remedies and organic living I make my own all natural cleaning supplies and use organic products to keep chemicals out of my house and body But I chose to get vaccinated and recently boosted against Covid because the risk factor was overwhelmingly obvious With the onset of Omicron the argument about doing it for society has become less powerful and eradicating Covid has also become less likely There s a lot more talk about Covid eventually shifting from pandemic to endemic But here s the stark reality people are still dying from Covid and most of those dying are unvaccinated And in case anyone wants to compare this to just another flu you should know that the worst flu season in recent years killed people in all of Dallas County Eighty Covid shot past that number in the first weeks of arriving in Dallas County I ll make one last comment The Covid deaths have been appalling but it doesn t stop there Many people who survived Covid including those who never had to be hospitalized continue to deal with what s being termed long Covid I know two people personally who have been essentially crippled by the long term effects of the disease and they both caught Covid in prior to a vaccine being available Brain fog crushing fatigue etc One a top nurse administrator in a large hospital had to leave the job and career she loved because she can no longer mentally function at that level The other is living in fear of being fired because he s not performing He can t He falls asleep anytime he sits down even to eat lunch I know nothing I ve shared will convince those who ve chosen to believe otherwise So be it I respect people s rights to make hard choices but hopefully based on accurate information

I started this post thinking I was going to write about the benefit vs risk of vaccinating children against Covid It s difficult to find any objective unbiased information or data on the topic since the MSM and anti social media are determined to toe the party line which is that the ONLY treatment is to vaccinate the planet In my research I stumbled on an incredibly interesting article that was published in August in Toxicology Reports a very highly respected scientific journal that s been published since
psychic predictions This is the year for balance and in numerology it s the year of the number There will be a huge shift this year and a final awakening for humanity Spiritual businesses will thrive and become more centre stage If your wanting to open up more and develop your gift of clairvoyance or mediumship to enable you to hear and work with spirit then this surge of energy will be strong and will help you connect and develop your psychic abilities this year As with all huge shifts this year will also have more natural disasters and in specific earthquakes tornados hurricanes and volcanic eruptions on a huge global scale There will be major hurricanes this year in North Carolina Florida and the Caribbean Global warming is driving this year and the unprecedented weather will cause significant world problems Ice melting In Siberia arctic could result in a new virus one that s quite deadly emerging which has been frozen Along with covid and the omicron variant there will also be another newer variant coming from possibly England and could be linked to South Africa which will be similar to a severe flu This new variant will impact further on the economy travel and cause more restrictions Spirit is telling me that is a year of strength and assertiveness with close focus on families and love We must be kind to one another come together and look after our own Mental Health will be severe this year due to the ongoing pandemic sadly this virus is here to stay and it will be before we can see any normality with civilisation adapting to covid and learning to live with it Spirit is calling on you to trust your intuition Be mindful of others as there will be a rise in erratic nehaviour and unrest amongst the people The governments are being deceptive however spirit is showing me that there will be exposure and governments will begin to collapse along with Educational systems and religion These will be rebuilt More truth to be exposed around government finances lies and corruption This is a transitional year and there will be many endings and new beginnings This will be Boris Johnson s last year There is a new female leader emerging someone we haven t known of Someone who will challenge and clear the debris caused by this UK Prime Minister This shall be a strong leader who puts families first Focus will be on new healthcare and education systems Gender classes and age will be addressed The disabled homeless and those who are relying on food banks will find more support and money will be increased As inflation grows the minimum wage will rise There will still be focus around conspiracy theorists who have fears and phobias around the virus and vaccine However spirit is saying the vaccine is working and everyone needs to take this wear there masks and look after one another Stress and phobias needs to be put to rest especially with the new variant about to emerge Spirit is telling me that we must listen to science and trust in God Trust the Angels Ask for help There will be some miracle this year in the Middle East Spirit is also showing that there will be global food shortages this year perhaps soon between January and April There will be water shortages around Italy Africa and India There is going to be a great famine Higher recession in Europe Australia and parts of America There is also focus on gender equality protests and females will get their salary increased to some degree The Royal Family will face another difficult year as I m seeing more and more allegations being exposed They must take accountability Someone is talking to the justice system and more names are coming out Prince Harry will also need to defend himself and Meghan Markle Spirit is showing me him writing and more interviews The truth will come out There is presenting work for Meghan this year and she will also speak about some incident that occurred and there showing me violence and a slap There is another baby for Prince Harry and Meghan another baby girl But I m seeing this will be I do not see any more children for Prince William ans Kate There is a link to William and Harry coming back together however this will be later on in a few years and there will be healing Spirit is showing William as the next King I am seeing Prince Charles abstaining and letting William take the crown Hollywood and Britney Spears There is more exposure coming from Hollywood around abuse corruption pay outs and famous actors being exposed as well as production This may result in the collapse of Hollywood Disney is also linked and there will be more exposed in a book written by Britney Spears There is also a wedding for Britney to her Persian finance Sam Asghari this year and spirit is showing a pregnancy for Britney Spirit is showing me formula and an accident will occur There may be a fatality The sporting world will adapt more to covid and will transition For the FIFA World Cup in there showing the winners being Croatia There will also be a female Tennis Player who will take the tournament grand slams Spirit is saying that from now until April avoid arguing with family friends work colleagues There will be those of us who are worrying around money and family spirit is urging a huge focus for us on self love this year There will be a huge spiritual breakthrough by the end of and there will be links to UFO with more sightings video recordings emerging and they are saying sound This could be communication from Aliens There will also be a new species of animal found either new DNA or a sighting of something we believed an urban legend The science will find out what this is either from fur that s found or DNA The summer months will see a surge in travel again to exotic places however this will become more a luxury and not as often as before Covid This will be reflected in the prices August will be a good time February nd sees a huge shift and many transformational changes occurring for people which are huge shifts in either career or love Love does seem to be high on the list for this year with heightened attraction sensuality and connections Twin flames will be meeting and coming together Old relationships behaviours will end and new chapters finally begin There is the possibility of an Asteroid coming to hit earth this year however this will be detected and there is missiles being fired to break this asteroid up No end of days is being predicted There may be an increase in violence disruption and agendas this year However Spirit is calling on the collective to change that Focus on healing love family and being kind and assertive for and disaster can be avoided Business can and will improve economy will recover however we may have to pay for covid for the next years I see an increase in adoption of remote home working and the arts being a huge focus with people writing more creating art studying more and new courses emerging for self awareness spirituality and energy healing I hope these predictions help you for Blessings Mechelle

Lane County Tribune is running a series of informative posts during this election year highlighting public messages from candidates for various public offices Here s a message about COVID safety precautions from David Loveall candidate for Lane County Commissioner Springfield Masks have truly become the black out window curtains to the soul William Shakespeare once said the eyes are the window to the soul but lately that s not enough for me I need the rest of the facial details I need those unique smiles I miss the dimples formed by joy I need the added tell tale signs of life behind the piece of dining tablecloth adapted with ear loops I can no longer tell if someone is either happy to see me from their eyes exclusively or if that unibrow twitch is because they re trying to remember which pocket the switchblade knife is hiding The Message bible says your eyes are windows into your body If you open your eyes wide in wonder and belief your body fills up with light If you live squinty eyed in greed and distrust your body is a dank cellar If you pull THE BLINDS ON YOUR WINDOWS what a dark life you will have Mathew We humans need more that just the eyes to recognize who and what We need to see enjoy and take in the whole face feeling the moment of greeting written across each person s window pane If there s anything I wish most for this new year is the rolling up and taking off of masks all of them both spiritual and actual My soul s aching to see the full soul window of people again without the blinds and I m betting so is the rest of the world too Blessings David Loveall
On Friday we listened We listened to our local hospitals and health care experts who have seen a increase in COVID patients They asked both the state and the county to implement a mask mandate to help our health care workers make it through this surge We listened to our local businesses who are struggling with staff shortages due to employees contracting COVID Of the local businesses that responded to our recent questionnaire nearly two thirds said they support a mask mandate To stay open they need to protect their employees We listened to our residents Of the residents that sent testimony to our County Council for last Friday s special session supported extension of our mask mandate We heard from many who need us to wear masks to keep their children and immunocompromised loved ones safe We listened to the majority of our County Council who voted to extend the mask mandate to protect the health of our residents I was disappointed in the decision by three of our Councilmembers to reject the pleas of hospitals business owners and residents To do nothing to stop the rapid spread of COVID that is leading to the unnecessary loss of life of our neighbors would have gone against our Anne Arundel County Department of Health Officer s obligation to protect our communities I want to thank Dr Kalyanaraman for taking this necessary step to protect the health and safety of all Anne Arundel County residents

Soooooo Let me understand this the CDC is now moving the goal posts for quarantine duration I have no issue whatsoever getting people back to work sooner than later none I agree at this point we have little choice considering the circumstances Some of the wounds we have suffered are unavoidable and others are the worst kind self inflicted wounds Because of FAKE news and lousy handing of this pandemic from day we are where we are today All the wrong people have been at the podium and the CDC has become a political organization Full stop I also understand the need for a balanced approach and dealing with a crisis of epic proportions However DO NOT tout science when you are making NON scientific decisions in order to try and balance the reality of what is needed at this time in the real world MILLIONS of people CHOSE their personal freedoms over being a patriotic American and doing the right thing We now have of people currently in hospitalized with COVID are the UNVACCINATED and OVERWHELMING the healthcare system costing the taxpayers billions with a B in All the while a FREE and readily available vaccine was and is available to prevent this calamity LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN A FREE AND READILY AVAILABLE VACCINE WAS AND IS AVAILABLE TO PREVENT THIS CALAMITY Yes I am not ignorant enough to not admit that occasionally a person vaccinated will unfortunately get admitted to the hospital with COVID despite their best efforts Yes that is a thing Nothing is full proof With that being said what do we mean when we say overwhelm the healthcare system what does that look like It means the doctors nurses cleaning people transport crews greeters EMTs nursing aides cooks lab technicians and on and on cannot sustain this tragedy at the level of response needed to take care of people Don t worry at all about hospital administration which includes now doctors and nurses now because they ran for the hills and were the first ones in line for a vaccine under the tent They even got their friends and families vaccinated before it was even available to the public at large They ll be just fine Why Because they are thieves of the worst kind So what systems have to deal with is not only COVID patients but the run through traffic that walks through our ERs every single day Especially this time of year People who have heart attacks strokes kidney or heart failure cancer related issues trauma and so on What do you think There are endless hospitals that go at your call in a good year that are just waiting open arms to care for an additional hundreds or thousands of patients in a moments notice WHERE do you put those sick people when there is no where to put them and NO ONE to truly care for them Don t think for one second that during wave people in hospitals didn t die of unintended neglect because they did We barely had PPE let alone a room reservation So since we need to get healthcare teams back working again ASAP to take care of the country in their times of most need SCREW THEM again Come on back early Let s overwork under pay the people who SELFLESSLY put themselves in HARMS way every single day to care for other citizens in our UN Unified country No problem come on back in essential workers Nurses already had nursing to patient ratios that were ridiculous to begin because hospitals are cheap to pay for more nurses They would rather ensure their salaries and make cuts to the true essentials in essential workers WHO do you think is really caring for patient during this pandemic Thats right NURSES Arguably the backbone and the glue that holds hospital units together all day everyday But hey you re not infectious anymore Why Because we say so Maybe not infectious but maybe so That s what I want an overworked recently sick amazing ICU nurse that may be shedding virus taking care of my mother in the ICU when she is deathly sick with something other than COVID only to contract COVID Really Is that where we are Guess we are so desperate we have no choice And you know what We do it We will do it Because we have a conscience We have a heart We have love for those that we don t know and have never met because we love what we do and because we believe in a purpose greater than ourselves So IF we can We will be there for YOU AMERICA So back to the science Honestly though based on what Everyone speaks to science They are speaking antiquated science at best To me it s all smoke and mirrors What data regarding OMICRON is currently available to guide this reduced quarantine time What What we know about Omicron is that it is the most contagious strain we have seen this far So contagious that it wiped out Delta in a matter of WEEKS to take the number spot on the list This new goal post shift is based on data from prior strains of COVID not OMICRON This is unacceptable In my neighborhood it s called BS Just be forthright and truthful It s really that simple We can handle the truth because we already know what and why you are doing it Even the biggest advocates of vaccinations masking distancing etc will begin to turn on you Get a spine Here s the truth Most testing is nonsense The rapid test is a waste of time Too early you ll miss it days later repeat it or get a PCR and it s positive In the meantime you ve infected likely tens of other people in your circle When people are sick they know When they aren t they aren t Yes you can be a carrier no doubt and be without symptoms BUT most people walking around have no idea they are and most aren t testing themselves So unless you are TESTING EVERYONE It s virtually useless The only role in my eyes for testing at this point is TEST to RETURN to work That makes sense The numbers of currently infected are grossly underestimated By millions Why Because we don t have a testing infra structure never did Almost everyone has either had is infected symptoms or not or will get infected with some form of coronavirus of the COVID variant variety The numbers that get posted and all the news media attention are INACCURATE AT BEST and probably underestimate by millions of people in this country alone Right now we are lucky the virus is evolving into a more contagious less deadly strain OMICRON However the potential remains that a new more virulent and deadly strain can develop Soooooo GO GET VACCINATED GET BOOSTED Eventually just like the flu we will have some true anti viral oral medications to treat people outside the hospital to prevent hospitalizations We are close When that happens you should still get vaccinated given that these vaccines are VERY SAFE and EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE against different strains clearly not all at this point Honestly if you are unvaccinated and get sick requiring hospitalization that s on you Your body your choice your freedom NO PROBLEM It s AMERICA after all I can do whatever I want when I want right NOT I can give you a hundred examples where that doesn t apply and you comply without question So spare the rhetoric It s also called BS If you are unvaccinated and get COVID then please stay the hell out of the hospital and be a grown up We teach our children this all the time Actions have consequences Don t they You don t trust the medical community enough to take a simple vaccine why the hell do you trust me then with your life when you get sick What changes Now you realize your potential for mortality Save me save me Sorry shouldn t work that way Live with your freedom and accept your choice Don t endanger me my team and my family that behaved like responsible adults and did the right thing Unless you want a hand out Literally LIVE FREE DIE HARD Andrey Espinoza MD FACC FSCAI RPVI Extremely frustrated physician

The education sector in Houston had some remarkable additions to leadership this week Yesterday I had the honor of swearing in both Kendall Baker and Bridget for the Kids as HISD Trustees after their successful reform campaigns They will both put the educational attainment of nearly k HISD students as their top priority speak out plainly about not running down CRT or other rabbit trails and stay on public policy that makes a positive difference in educating our school kids The HISD Board of Trustees has to leave the world of lawsuits and board corruption behind and start making the decision that can help close the COVID gap in education test scores Only of all HISD students are testing at grade level which means the task is enormous I believe Trustees Baker and Wade bring that view to the board and new leadership as well Also had a chance to swear in my old friend David Wilson back on to the Houston Community College Board Trustee Wilson gave an important set of remarks commenting on all the other board members backgrounds and what they can accomplish together My brief remark was that I m glad he s back on the board on behalf of all the taxpayers of Harris County To shed some insight the HCC Board has lost a couple of Trustees due to Federal law enforcement cases and they too need to leave the world of lawsuits and corruption behind and focus on student educational attainment These have been important elections for folks with conservative principles getting involved back into Houston education positions Senator Paul Bettencourt

If you re a homeowner this could definitely be worth a read for you What is going on in the property market I think last year took so many of us by surprise A continuation of covid and the challenges and excuses it offers Excuses as it seems so many industries used covid as a means of explaining away bad service and delays The challenges however were more evident Whilst the travel hospitality and retail industry were slaughtered other sectors seemed to thrive Car sales and car prices increased as an example Whilst house sales numbers may not have increased the value of property and the eventual sale price certainly did Even from what seemed like a tremendous peak in Estate Agents had to adapt to challenges on staff sickness and knock on effects on opening hours We had to inform ourselves and the market about the ever changing legislation often different from country to country within the British Isles We had to adapt to the ever increasing offers but bear in mind that these offers often came within the first few days So a decision was taken individually on every home for every client on whether we take a substantial offer or hold for closing This of course led to confused vendors and angry buyers who were either annoyed at losing out or being blown away in a closing date Despite all this we felt Regents were best suited to coping and adapting A small professional company can react and turn quicker than a slow corporate We could give the best advice for our area immediately Rather than a corporate one fits all compromise that may have suited no one THIS IS WHY WE WON THE GOLD AWARD FOR DUNFERMLINE AND VOTED SILVER SECOND BEST ESTATE AGENT IN THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND What then for We see the same trends continuing as the market is fuelled not necessarily by lockdown restrictions Brexit or indeed a need and want to spend on property due to savings created by lockdown The driving factor was and remains demand and supply There are too little available homes for the current buyer demand Too few bungalows and property s with gardens for the number of people desperate to purchase Too many flats in short supply for the army of first time buyers and buy to let investors So we are as willing and able as last year to repeat our extraordinary performance in customer care in adaptation and ability to achieve the best outcome for all that give us their trust Reset Prepare Repeat Kindest regards Gary Scott Sales Director estateagent estateagency estateagentsuk SellingOrBuying selling buyingandsellingproperties buyingandsellinghomes buyingahome mortgageadvice mortgage rem regentsestateagents homesfife property propertymarket propertyforsale firsttimebuyer firsttimebuyersuk houseforsale

Twenty one of our neighbors in Anne Arundel County lost their lives last week to COVID That s an average of three per day They are not numbers they are human beings with families and friends We are projected to continue losing our people at that rate or higher in the coming weeks I had hoped we were done with government mandates in our COVID response but science is clear that masks slow the spread of this virus Masks keep kids in school workers on the job people out of hospitals and people alive They don t save everyone but they do save some Our hospital leaders pleaded with the County Council to extend the mask mandate citing studies that show more people mask when it s required Of the local businesses that responded to our recent questionnaire nearly two thirds said that they support a government mask mandate They want to protect their employees and the economy that sustains them Of the county residents that sent testimony to our County Council for last Friday s special session supported extension of our mask mandate All of our neighboring counties have implemented temporary mask mandates to address this super surge and the Governor is once again saying Wear the damn mask So what the hell is going on with the Anne Arundel County Republican Party All three of its representatives on the seven member County Council voted Friday to end our county s mask mandate the day after their party sent an anti mask fundraising appeal On November th the same three council members voted against accepting million in desperately needed state grants to continue our Health Department s COVID vaccination program testing and opioid intervention work It s a strange development The Baltimore County Council also has a seven person council with three Republicans on it and they put together a person supermajority in favor of a mask mandate Republican led counties across the state are eagerly accepting state grants to combat this virus I m often told by keyboard activists from the far right that my commitment to slow the spread of this virus in our county will cost me the next election a risk I take willingly The unfortunate reality however is that it s not just an online fringe that is challenging the longstanding consensus that public health and public safety are a fundamental obligation of government It s also the party leadership and even the candidates who are running campaigns to put themselves in this job Herb McMillan uses this newspaper as his vehicle to weave circular logic about COVID that would likely be banned by Twitter and Facebook and the political machine behind Jessica Haire uses expensive television ads during Fox News The Haire campaign chaired by her husband and transitory candidate for County Executive Dirk Haire went so far as to run television ads in recent weeks suggesting that business closures early in the pandemic the ones that were mandated by Governor Hogan were a failure of leadership I won t shrink away from the debate over the obligation of government to protect its people the longstanding bi partisan American tradition of government driven vaccination programs and health orders and even the specifics of every difficult decision that I the Governor and my peers in neighboring counties have made during this pandemic in consultation with our health officers This county s Republican Party used to represent fiscal conservatism and a healthy disdain for excessive regulation It has recently become so ferociously opposed to delivering the basic functions of local government that its leaders are no longer capable of managing the public institutions that they malign So as we enter this election year we must show passion in defense of our local public servants and the work that they do on behalf of our residents We must show the contrasts between the progress we are making and efforts to undermine that progress And we must never back down in defense of our right to protect the health and safety of our beloved neighbors

On behalf of Liberal Democrat Councillors in the Hertford Stortford constituency County Councillor Calvin Horner and the leader of the opposition on East Herts District Council Mione Goldspink have released a joint statement We are appalled by the behaviour of the Prime Minister and his staff at No The revelations about all the various gatherings parties which were held in clear breach of the Covid regulations are shocking The fact that the rules were broken by the very people who had made them is most alarming The parties were being held at the same time as ordinary law abiding citizens were making enormous personal sacrifices in order to keep to the rules They were not able to visit or say good bye to dying relatives they could not attend funerals they could not visit the lonely could not meet friends in a park They suffered real distress and anguish The Prime Minister must take responsibility for the rule breaking in No He did nothing to stop the partying even attending some events himself His claims that he thought that some of the parties were work meetings is pathetic and demonstrates a complete lack of judgement People are angry very angry They have no respect for the Prime Minister who is perceived to be a law breaker and they have no trust whatsoever in him or his judgement We call on him to do the honourable thing and to resign It would be consistent for our MP Julie Marson to similarly urge the Prime Minister to resign Ms Marson is on record as saying that all elected councillors in local government should be worthy of trust How much more should the leader of the Government be worthy of trust We challenge Ms Marson to do the logical thing and herself to call on the Prime Minister to resign

The pandemic has brought long standing hospital staffing problems to a crisis point and things are only getting worse The Omicron surge has pushed Washington s hospitals to their highest weekly average since the pandemic began There are also fewer staff members to care for patients because many healthcare workers are themselves sick with COVID Healthcare workers say staffing levels were a big problem before the pandemic and now they re asking WAleg for safe staffing standards It s not enough to hire more staff healthcare workers say if we don t have a plan to retain them It is really really important that people who come into this industry know that they re going to have these safe staffing standards so they don t get burnt out and leave We have to start with these standards because this is the only way that we ll be able to get more people into the workforce said Jane Hopkins a registered nurse and the executive vice president of SEIU Healthcare NW

I m Joe Larkins a Navy veteran from Gulfport Mississippi and I was years old when I found out I was dying I pretty much came to believe that it was meant to be And so I went ahead and wrote my living will prepared for my disposal when I was gone wrote letters to my friends and talked to my family And I just said You know it s not that big of a deal My time is over I was diagnosed with end stage terminal liver disease caused by chemicals I was exposed to while repairing boats and not taking proper safety precautions The doctors weren t optimistic My liver was deteriorating and I was in agonizing pain I visited the hospital several times a week to drain the waste my liver couldn t process and the doctors told me I would need a liver transplant to survive I had more than once begged my dad to bring me one of my pistols and one of my bullets so that I could go ahead and get it over with the pain and problems of having a terminal illness I had already taken the time to fill out a living will with a DNR so that there wouldn t be any attempts to try to bring me back or put me on life support I got so bad I was actually trying to get into a nursing home because there was just no way that I could live on my own anymore and when I got to a nursing home in November I was on compassionate care through hospice and I was not expected to live through Christmas of that year Although I was on a transplant list even if I got approved they couldn t do it then So either I was going to flat out die or I was going to get a transplant That was five years ago neither have happened Death was knocking at my door I was given about a month to live and then suddenly made a miraculous turn My liver started to regenerate Livers will do that but my doctors did not expect mine to regenerate since it was operating at about Inexplicably to my doctors my liver today is operating at about While most of my doctors won t admit it I m pretty sure I know what s behind my second lease on life I was on all these kinds of harmful narcotic painkillers and Xanax but opioids are bad for your liver because your liver has to process the trash out of your system and opiates are trash I didn t want to be on them But I had a friend who knew I was in pain and wanted to see if she could help ease my pain in the final weeks of my life She d pick me up from the nursing home we d drive somewhere smoke a little marijuana spend some time together and returned to the nursing home You remember me mentioning how I wanted to die Well smoking marijuana removed my desire to accelerate my death It helped me manage my expectations of what life is going to be like with a terminal illness It helped me not only emotionally but also medically My eyes and skin were initially yellow and sickly and that suddenly changed I was like what the hell s going on And my appetite changed so I was able to eat some of my favorite foods again Most of my doctors won t admit it but I m certain I did some research and I found out that it was possible marijuana could help regenerate liver cells So I started to use marijuana more frequently Next thing we know I m well enough that I m getting ready to move out of the nursing home and go to an assisted facility and hopefully progress from there back to living on my own completely One doctor did say he thought marijuana played a positive role and my nurse practitioner agreed as well Recently my nurse practitioner took me off all the narcotics they were giving me and she agreed that if it were not for cannabis I would not be in the position I am now The owners of my nursing home knew about my situation At first I would only smoke off campus and never inside so they didn t care But once COVID came we couldn t have visitors so I couldn t go smoke with my friend I was in pain and didn t want to take narcotics I felt my only option was to smoke inside Again the owners didn t care but they recently got new management that s tied to a larger corporate entity who does not approve The management invited me to voluntarily leave within days but the owners put that on hold to allow me to get my affairs in order Much of the staff and patients actually voted for Initiative last year legalizing medical marijuana for patients with debilitating medical conditions until the state Supreme Court struck it down When the initiative passed everybody here got excited We have residents who because of their different diseases or dementias struggle every day Lots of patients here agree that it will help ease pains fears and erratic behavior I m preparing to move out and found an assisted living facility that I ll soon transition to I m hopeful that one day I ll be able to live independently without any assistance and without fear of punishment I should not be alive I ve been given a second chance at life and I m grateful for that I personally hope medical marijuana becomes law in Mississippi so I don t have to worry about going to jail for using something that is beneficial to me If it weren t for cannabis I wouldn t be here today Joe Larkins Gulfport Mississippi

CHANGE IS IN THE WIND January Good Wednesday morning Welcome to RUPP S NOTES FBI SPECIAL AGENT HARTMANN SERIES weekly post I m the author Richard V Rupp writing from Burbank California Robocalls are driving me nuts I suspect it has something to do with the work from home thing Both in who is making the calls and the fact more people are at home to receive them Over the past couple of weeks I averaged six to eight a day Today s post is an example of what I did for a living many years ago Advise management based on my research on what changes may impact the business in the foreseeable future But instead of writing a report to senior insurance company management I will present what I foresee to you and use some of the material in my upcoming novel SKYWARD Significant factors that I believe will impact the new normal are Impact of the changing of the guard as Millennials and Gen Z s take over running things This is a shrinking world caused by overpopulation and decreased usable landmass due to climate change The darkening of the populations complexion caused by migration and changing birthrates A move toward socialist structure A move away from fossil fuels and Yes the long term impact caused by the COVID pandemic An example of what the pandemic has done is the consideration by Lloyd s of London to move from their flagship City of London headquarters I spend a lot of time in both the original Lloyds building and its replacement tower designed by British architect Richard Rogers Why the move Because the pandemic speeded up Lloyds move to automation and away from doing business on its underwriting floor A Lloyd s spokesperson said As we adapt to new structures and flexible ways of working we are continuing to carefully think about the future requirements for the spaces and services our marketplace needs Like many other organizations we are considering a range of options around our workspace strategy and the future leasing arrangements for Lloyd s Companies are reassessing their office space as the COVID pandemic showed working from home was viable Lloyd s is just one example of how businesses have been impacted and why office space is now being converted to apartments and condos Millennials and Z s don t live in the past and except for scientific advancements consider historical social information of little value Like my dad used to tell me Don t look in the rearview mirror unless you want to go that way Millennials and Z s are either looking ahead or are looking at a metaverse unreal or make believe world This is evident because they don t believe traditional higher education is of value In fact they think it may slow down their advancement in the world This fall has seen the sharpest enrolment decline among people and older into four year colleges according to Clearinghouse data They see their peers entering the working world through inventiveness tied to electronic devices Doug Shapiro executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center said in an interview Students are questioning the value of college They may be looking at friends who graduated last year or the year before who didn t go and they seem to be doing fine The above concept is also seen in reading habits change A December Gallup poll indicates that fewer people are reading books The average American adult read just over books in the smallest average number than any prior survey dating back to The number of big readers has dropped hard and that s what s weighing on the overall average Currently just report that they read more than books Gallup says down eight percentage points since and lower than every prior measure by at least four points That decline was particularly marked among college graduates and older readers I had to laugh at an article that indicated Men are finally catching up to women when it comes to book reading That s only because women are reading fewer books The Gallup editors conclude Reading appears to be in decline as a favorite way for Americans to spend their free time Millennials and Z s also tie religion to the past and have placed it on the chopping block A recent Pew Research Center report indicates that the number of Americans with no religious affiliation has nearly doubled over the past years from to Self identified Christians dropped from to during the same period Most Americans believe U S democracy is in danger According to a Brookings report one in five Americans has views that make them at least open to if not outright supportive of authoritarianism According to CNN of us are angry about the state of the nation and USA Today indicates that only of us think things are going well think civil war is likely and we are split about equal as to dividing the country into two parts Aogby Analytics ABC News says of us believe the economy is doing poorly And have been adversely affected by inflation Yet according to a Gallup survey of Americans say they are currently thriving the highest number in years The use by large corporations of bots A I and automation in general will significantly increase as the attitude of the workforce changes pushed by the pandemic A record number of U S workers have quit their jobs in the past few months More than million people voluntarily walked away from their positions in November up from million in October November s figure was the highest since the government started tracking the figure two decades ago Government regulations to curb the use of fossil fuels and infrastructure investments will increase the use of electric vehicles and drones The inefficiencies of wind and solar energy will renew the interest in nuclear power The United States and China will dramatically expand their military drones and bots technology The newly developed weapon systems will significantly change warfare The U S may test these new weapon systems in Ukraine with the U S providing advisors to Ukraine if Russian troops invade Finally all of the above convinces me that increased inflation will be with us for the next couple of years It was at in December The cost of food my steaks at Costco have gone up apparel and especially used cars are draining our wallets a lot faster The Federal Reserve is on high alert for how this could affect the economy Back to researching thinking and using the above info in my novel SKYWARD Please be kind to each other and stay safe Cheers Richard V Rupp Author Website www richardvrupp com Email rupprisk gmail com Copyright by Richard V Rupp

LEGISLATIVE UPDATE Here s a report from me as to how the Republican establishment threw medical freedom under the bus last week I tried to run an amendment on HB last week My amendment would have given complete protection for Hoosiers by making it illegal for anybody to impose enforce a vaccination upon another person My amendment was called out of order by Representative Dan Leonard and I was told that it was not germane to the bill and that it was bill pending The establishment released HB that same morning and I had drafted my amendment days prior to the release of HB they were saying that I used language from a bill that I did not even know existed at the drafting of my amendment and thus they used one of the House rules to call me out of order How does one draft an amendment from a bill that doesn t exist Answer they can t That is utterly absurd My amendment absolutely had everything to do with HB Representative Dan Leonard who argued with me behind the scenes off camera explaining why my amendment was not germane I explained to him this was a constitutional issue on bodily integrity autonomy and had EVERYTHING to do with HB Representative Leonard just looked at me like I had lost my mind I could only assume Representative Leonard s disdain was because I brought the Constitution into the conversation I then asked Speaker Todd Huston to call down Chairman Representative Heath VanNatter who was the chairman over HB to get a commitment from him to get a hearing and a vote on HB and to be able to announce publicly from the podium that I would withdraw my amendment if I could get the commitment from chairman VanNatter for the hearing and vote Speaker Huston just looked at me disgusted very visibly annoyed and said repetitively and very emphatically to me No No HB would have put a ban on COVID vaccinations But the sad reality is that the establishment did not want to go on record for truly protecting Hoosiers How disgusting

A LITTLE CLARITY PLEASE Let me be the first to say I appreciate the fact that we still have a local newspaper that covers local news While the AP articles are not always unbiased I continue to support and subscribe as I have for many years Most of the time I feel I am quoted accurately however I feel the need to clarify the verbiage of a few quotes attributed to me in a recent article First I did not describe the Save Women Sports Act as ensuring transgender women cannot participate in women s sports Instead I have been consistent in stating that BIOLOGICAL MALES should not be allowed to compete against girls and women This is important to me because use of the woke term transgender women implies that a person can actually change their sex This is not only scientifically impossible but in my opinion gives people the false belief they can do so Second the article stated I supported a bill to ban critical race theory although critical race theory is not in the state s school curriculum Unfortunately the latter is often repeated media commentary not my words CRT has been included in curriculum at USC and Clemson in teacher training nationwide and likely at some SC public schools based on the numerous complaints of concerned parents While the words critical race theory are not necessarily used the tenets of the theory include the teaching that an individual by virtue of his race or sex is inherently racist sexist or oppressive whether consciously or unconsciously and an individual should feel guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race or sex I said to the Index that no one should be taught to be ashamed of their race in our state and I stand by that statement Finally I pointed out that the courts are currently dealing with federal COVID mandates and there is not a lot that a state legislature can do This does not mean that we have not tried to ban mandates nor does it mean there is no role for the legislature in responding to the pandemic In partnership with Governor McMaster we have certainly been involved in allocating both state and federal funds on an emergency basis to mitigate the pandemic for the last two years Index thank you for allowing me to clarify these quotes If you want to print this as my letter to the editor please feel free to do so

I have received an overwhelming number of emails regarding the mask mandate both in favor and in opposition I have read and appreciate each and every one of them It is important that citizens are engaged and regardless of your position let elected officials know your thoughts I do want to be clear and let everyone know where I stand specifically in reference to the mask mandate Prior to being elected in November I campaigned on being a champion for parental rights Having said that I will only support optional mask wearing If parents want to have their children masked they certainly are entitled to that right and with that parents who choose to not have their children masked should also have that same right extended to them I am aware of Governor Youngkin s Executive Order and SB Senator Dunnavant the patron of that bi partisan legislation who is a practicing physician stated this legislation was not intended to force school systems to follow CDC recommendations regarding masks Hint The word recommendation is important here SB also uses terms such as to the maximum extent possible which lends itself to interpretation Having said that I do believe we must continue to be diligent in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID My suggestions to the Board have included ideas such as improved air quality measures air filtration systems UV lighting etc increased on site testing in schools VISSTA a model already being used by other localities in Virginia and ongoing physical distancing and sanitation measures I look forward to today s retreat and robust conversation with fellow board members regarding the above mentioned thoughts I am hopeful we can walk away with a plan that ends mask mandates while still working to keep children and families in Augusta County safe and well

We re on day two of requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test for dining in The logistics have actually been pretty easy and customers have been cheerful and almost all appreciative Thanks But the reality is there haven t been very many of you here It s been very cold and January is always a slow month so may or may not be because of the mandate We don t know if our experience is shared by restaurants all over the city but guessing it s pretty likely there are many restaurants across the city right now with owners that are staring at very empty dining rooms and not sure what s next At Common Roots we ll work our way through this and look forward to warmer less covid y times ahead but the truth is the financial numbers are worse these weeks than at any point in the past couple years It was much harder to operate last year but we also had very large government support programs to help us keep going and employ people Those programs are gone A small portion of restaurants got very large grants from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund but most got nothing We were in the nothing group And now we have a vaccine mandate as a new unknown We support the mandate It s the right thing for public safety for helping to try to keep our customers safe and our hospitals and medical staff from being even more excessively over strained But it s also a big unknown for restaurants will less people show up Is this one more thing that suppresses sales even more and asks more of our staff in an already bad time Or maybe this will actually make more people feel safe dining out We don t know the answer yet But we re sure this would be an excellent time to buy something from your favorite restaurants Go out to eat if you re comfortable doing so order to go or delivery if you re still hesitant to dine out And for our city leaders of all kinds elected officials media religious leaders neighborhood leaders people who have lots of friends whatever this would be a great time to encourage people who can afford to and feel comfortable doing so to get some great food or drink from small businesses they love and want to continue to have in their neighborhoods We can have a vaccine mandate AND rally support for our restaurants As for Common Roots we ve added Friday Night Family Meal boxes and Care Package deliveries which are helping keep some staff busy And we ll be creatively trying to keep our minds focusing on Patio season that can t be that far away already right We re serving up good food and drink in our cafe private dining room and for pickup or delivery Wed Friday a p Sat Sun a p We re looking forward to the day when our hospitals aren t near full our front line workers aren t exhausted and we can be around people in public spaces and not be thinking about risks We re all on our way to that place It s just a meandering path we re all on together

In challenging times like these Marylanders look to the government for help Last year the Maryland Comptroller s Office rose to the challenge by disbursing hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID financial assistance to our citizens in record time Unfortunately unacceptable delays caused by other state agencies meant that for many Marylanders this aid simply didn t come fast enough The Maryland Department of Labor completely dropped the ball on keeping up with unemployment claims as citizens lost their jobs and the Maryland Department of Education experienced significant delays in processing federal grant money for child care providers Failures like these have lowered public trust in the competence of state government If I m blessed to be your next Governor I ll make sure government once again gets the basics right for our working families You deserve responsive respectful and results oriented service and under my leadership that s exactly what I will deliver Learn more about my plan at

A message from Telescope Health Co founder COO Dr Matthew Thompson regarding the Omicron variant and COVID vaccines Breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated are expected but vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness hospitalizations and death Evidence suggests fully vaccinated people who become infected with the Omicron variant can still spread the virus to others so use caution around family and friends who are at high risk All FDA approved or authorized vaccines are expected to be effective against severe illness hospitalizations and deaths Additionally Omicron has been associated with higher rates of false negative rapid tests If you are worried about an exposure or have symptoms and your rapid test is negative get a PCR test also What else can you do Go get your booster especially if you are years of age or have risk factors Use common sense and avoid close contact with anyone who has active symptoms If you are going to be in a crowd of people concert sporting event etc wear a mask Learn more about the Omicron variant from CDC Global

I had my first bill hearing of the Legislative Session today for HB Maryland Medical Assistance Program Emergency Service Transporters Reimbursement First responders are facing several novel challenges in the field including appropriate funding to confront modern emergencies I appreciate the support on this bill from multiple local jurisdictions and EMS First Responder advocacy groups This bill does a few things First it gradually increases the medicaid emergency service transport reimbursement rate from the current rate by each year until it reaches This gradual increase will ensure EMS are being properly reimbursed to maintain financial solvency for services rendered while allowing the State to appropriately account for this increase MDH has indicated they can handle this gradual increase with existing resources and revenues Secondly this bill allows the reimbursement to be dispersed for treat not transport or TNT This practice is especially prevalent for drug overdoses and similar emergencies where for whatever reason the patient may not be transported to a hospital This will also have some additional unseen savings in situations where an emergency transport would be able to treat a medical issue on site rather than face an incentive to take a patient to an ER to collect the above mentioned reimbursement and further utilize ER resources and space Thirdly we are considering an amendment to include telehealth services in this bill I considered the issue a couple years ago but it was still considered a fairly novel concept at the time However since COVID including telehealth in this area of policy has much broader support to include in the bill this year This will also help to offset some of the cost increases by enabling on site treatment as mentioned above to incorporate telehealth Read more info and keep track of this legislation here

I am proud to announce our campaign has been endorsed by the Texas AFL CIO the state federation of labor unions representing teachers firefighters and farm workers actors and engineers painters and plumbers steelworkers and screenwriters doctors and nurses stagehands and electricians and more The COVID pandemic has transformed our relationship to work I have been in the classroom throughout the pandemic and I have seen the burnout the anxiety the fear on display during otherwise daily tasks It is no secret our teachers and school employees have always been overworked and underpaid But the pandemic has forced us to ask ourselves If we truly believe our schools are educating the leaders of tomorrow then what kind of work are we demanding from our educators It is much more than hard work It is nearly impossible work given the system we are working in I am running for the State Board of Education to change that system so it can work better for all students families and school employees Our work should not be deadly and that means re opening schools safely with extensive input from staff on implementing precautions for a safe working environment Our work should be healthy and that means having access to mental health resources and counselors on campus Our work should be meaningful and that means moving away from high stakes STAAR testing and toward teaching important subjects like service learning digital literacy computer science and ethnic studies I believe the true work on the State Board of Education will begin when the pandemic ends and we will need a new leader with new solutions for the problems we will face in this new world I am ready to work hard for you

I am a non ideological registered independent fiscal conservative and social moderate I believe that our biggest domestic problem by far is out of control national debt Our biggest international problem is the rise of China now our greatest autocratic rival Here is how I evaluate the Biden Presidency after a year in office his plunging poll ratings his inability to deal effectively with either Covid or increasing inflation the federal reserve is prepared to address inflation by raising interest rates and reducing bond holdings This could easily lead to stagflation inflation plus recession which would further hurt Biden a red wave is likely in November which will lead to GOP control of the House and likely also the Senate Biden will still be president for two more years and we should all want him to succeed in foreign policy by reining in our autocratic rivals What do you think

RESPONSE TO VERN BUCHANAN R FL CHALLENGES The opinion by Congressman Vern Buchanan R FL captioned We must address the challenges we face in in the Sarasota Herald Tribune Jan skews priorities Buchanan says not a word about the continuing pandemic and escalating infections hospitalizations and deaths With the Omicron variant spreading rapidly the United States is averaging over new Covid cases a day higher than at any previous point and Florida is in the vanguard Buchanan also fails to appreciate the broader healthcare crisis and the need for quality affordable healthcare for all Buchanan voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times with no viable substitute Moreover with eight of the ten oldest Congressional districts including FL in Florida he voted repeatedly to turn Medicare into a premium support vouchers system and to cut health funding He has also consistently opposed choice and women s interests voting against the Women s Health Protection Act Paycheck Fairness Act and Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act Nor does Buchanan recognize that our democratic republic too is ailing Spurred by exhortations by the then president to Stop the Steal and Fight Like Hell thousands of armed rioters stormed the United States Capitol on January and at least five people died as a result Nevertheless Buchanan was among Republicans boycotting the Special Committee to Investigate the January Attack and declining to join the Congressional commemoration a year later Moreover restrictive voter laws passed in various states in but Buchanan is unconcerned over efforts to subvert elections and civil rights by voter suppression and gerrymandering He most recently voted nay on the Voter Rights Advancement Act While Buchanan does appreciate that it s the economy stupid he fails to offer viable suggestions Obviously inflation and consumer prices have spiked way too high but at least unemployment has dropped below and other economic indicators have improved significantly Meanwhile Buchanan s own selfish economic priority has been to vote for and tout the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with or so of benefits going to corporations and individuals in the top On deficits and debt Buchanan hypes his proposal to amend the United States Constitution to require a balanced federal budget While the idea of balanced budgets is itself appealing such an amendment would deprive federal policymakers of essential flexibility to address national security and economic emergencies On the environment one looks in vain for any reference to climate change Extreme weather events in many exacerbated by climate change set new records around the world Time is short to forestall a global catastrophe As to other environmental issues Buchanan holding a roundtable on red tide and working to protect manatees and other species are noble efforts But these do not compensate for ignoring climate science One could go on and on about challenges Buchanan wholly or partially disregards On foreign policy yes the Biden administration bungled the withdrawal from Afghanistan but rather than this being the biggest foreign policy disaster in a generation it got us out of the longest war in U S history On law enforcement yes crime is skyrocketing defund the police is a ridiculous slogan and the vast majority of our first responders are brave and honorable but there are abuses many discriminatory that must be remedied And yes our porous southern border is of great concern as are all kinds of drug trafficking but an ugly wall of rusting steel has not proven effective To end where Buchanan began asserting that Americans have seemingly never been more divided than under President Joe Biden is absurd Remember the lies of the last presidency culminating in an insurrection

This is our story The story of a young Muslim immigrant from the council estate taking on Prime Minister Boris Johnson Across the Western world people are desperate for a radical shift in the kinds of politics and politicians that they are presented with Primary defeats to established figures and shock results in referendums are becoming the norm while outsiders are shaking up political cultures In this book Ali Milani a rising star in the UK s Labour Party brings a unique perspective on the key political issues we are now facing in the wake of the COVID pandemic to show how young people from different backgrounds can engage in politics Using his rollercoaster campaign against Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the UK s general election and his time in Bernie Sanders campaign team he inspires a new generation of political leaders from the disenfranchised disillusioned and marginalised to usher in a new wave of diverse voices and experience in mainstream politics

With the war in the Middle East that recently ended rising tensions with China and now talks of war with Russia there is one common thread Our nation s weakness is our reliance on other countries that don t have our best interests We saw this when COVID hit in March of our production of masks tests ventilators all done overseas by China When it comes to energy Russia and the Middle East have had much control over our energy resources What kind of nation relies on other rival nations for our most valuable resources One that is in a weak position Energy security IS national security In restoring our country we must not be reliant on others for our energy Under President Trump we received barrels of oil a day while under Biden we are receiving over times that amount As a result we ve seen gas and energy prices skyrocket across the country This is what happens when you destroy American energy independence Right now we are seeing the repercussions of Biden s failing energy policies Nations are becoming more reliant on Russian energy creating instability around the world You can see this in Germany with their reluctance to support Ukraine Again energy security is national security But most importantly the idea that we should send our young men and women overseas to fight for the nations that refuse to send their own is insane Why should we fight for nations that are scared to upset their energy provider When our allies are not energy independent that too is a national security risk for us So what s the bottom line To keep Americans safe we need strong national security To have strong national security we need strong energy security With us and our allies relying on opposing nations for energy we are putting Americans last and our enemies first In running for Congress becoming an energy independent nation is something that we will continue fighting for America does not need to fight another endless war over energy we ve already shed too much blood

I am Triple Jabbed and I believe vaccines work and the Covid Vaccines have been extremely helpful and credit to the British People for having the highest uptake of vaccinations in OECD countries But I have serious reservations about mandatory vaccinations I do not support Govt s policy of mandatory NHS vaccination and more importantly the narrative Sajid Javid is pushing in order to force through this policy My reasons are as follows Informed Consent is a core pillar of modern medical ethics It took over years to be developed after analysing through the atrocities of the Holocaust that were specifically committed in the name of medical experiments To undermine informed consent would be to undermine modern medicinal practice Will we be making treatment for mandatory for Hep B and HIV as those pose a huge threat to the public as well This narrative that Sajid Javid has used about unvaccinated staff posing a danger to patients has NO substantial data behind it and he being a politician sat with his media advisors after getting owned by Dr Steve James and came up with this line That interaction was almost the end for his hopes of leading the Conservative Party someday and he had to come out in the media with a counter narrative I have many colleagues who are not vaccinated but are some of the most dedicated healthcare professionals The idea that all these staff are now a danger to patients when they were all a blessing in the first lockdown with no vaccines reeks of hypocrisy I do medicine and politics and my experience in public health has taught me both are intertwined but this narrative is full of pitfalls and can erode public trust in medical staff The above two reasons should be good enough to pause and cancel the introduction of mandatory vaccination irrespective of job profile With the waiting list so long will losing valuable trained and dedicated staff help in any way If we are opening the country up again people then can catch Covid from anyone What is the whole point of making a scapegoat out of Healthcare professionals Could you not get Covid from the cashier at the till or someone serving you at a restaurant or a bar The UK is introducing Paxlovid from February the drug which can reduce hospitalisation and deaths by if infected with Covid Why are we then introducing such draconian measures for NHS staff This govt policy must have a review I know the whole political spectrum is busy with one thing only right now but we must not ignore the ramifications once this policy is implemented I have no problem with an annual Covid vaccine although we must be careful about vaccine fatigue if we introduce weekly vaccines which one company once suggested if i am not mistaken Before any idiot tries to portray me as anti vax I was completely vaccinated according to WHO guidelines while growing up in Bangladesh and before starting for the NHS I had voluntarily got vaccinated with the additional ones I was eligible for at the time as UK has an expanded vaccination programme and for the last years I have diligently taken all my flu vaccines annually I am as pro vaccination as anyone can get but I do not believe in compulsion Pro vaccination should not mean mandatory vaccination If I supported mandatory vaccinations I would have gone to China not the West Please CancelMandatoryVaccination Say NoToMandatoryVaccination

Closed Door Back Room Deals At City Hall Must End Well this is interesting First off I want you to look at the letters in red at the top of the first page of this document ALDERMEN CONFIDENTIAL closed record This document was never meant to be revealed to the citizens of Parkville Why is that Well I have a few questions Why is the Board of Aldermen planning to build a new luxury apartment complex next to the river inside a floodplain Why are they using the same development firm that destroyed Kansas City s formerly beautiful Berkley Riverfront Park Does the Board of Aldermen think they re spending Monopoly money What will be the impact on English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park What will be the impact of extra traffic on Downtown Parkville Will this benefit the community as a whole or will it just make an already wealthy developer even more wealthy Implications of building this apartment complex inside a floodplain Information from a current Parkville resident Flooding is generally the most common and costliest type of disaster Missouri experiences but standard homeowner s insurance does not cover flooding so it s important to have protection from damage associated with flooding SEMA s Floodplain Management Section administers the National Flood Insurance Program NFIP for the state of Missouri NFIP offers flood insurance to homeowners renters and business owners if their community participates in the program providing more than billion in flood insurance coverage for Missouri homes and business annually Participating communities agree to adopt and enforce floodplain management ordinances that meet or exceed FEMA requirements So the long and short of it is Parkville taxpayers you and me will have to pay in added taxes for flood insurance Impact on Parkville s parks If you remember Berkley Park in Kansas City before Flaherty Collins came in and covered it with apartments it was a large beautiful park on the river with many events festivals concerts etc It was a place where people could gather with their families Now nothing really happens there The only use is for people to walk the river trail Is this what we want for English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park I think not Impact on the businesses in Downtown Parkville Traffic coming through Downtown Parkville can already be congested This new stack em pack em apartment complex would turn downtown and the roads leading into it into a virtual parking lot The businesses there are already struggling trying to come out of the COVID restrictions placed on them by the County Health Board Deterring shoppers from coming into Downtown by creating huge traffic blockages would put the final nail in the coffin for them This is just common sense Anyone can see that except our Board of Aldermen Or maybe they do see it and they just don t care Benefit to the community So the citizens of Parkville will be on the hook for in increased taxes It will ruin English Landing Park and Platte Landing Park That means no more events downtown Parkville Days gone Fourth of July events gone Parkville Microbrew Festival gone Downtown shopping gone These all promote and bring people into the city to spend money Also how does providing the developer Flaherty Collins million million in incentives to build this monstrosity benefit the community as a whole The answer It doesn t So why would the Board of Aldermen even consider this plan And why would they want to keep it secret What else is City Hall hiding from us This is a prime example of why we need a change in City Hall This is why we need to be in the room when these things are being discussed This is why there should be NO private confidential meetings When it comes to issues that are going to have a massive impact on the community and businesses of the city there should be maximum transparency and community oversight It doesn t matter to me how things have always been done If elected Mayor of Parkville I will put you in the room I will be your voice And if the Board of Aldermen don t like that Tough I won t stand by and allow them to Kansas City our Parkville

A lot of GOP politicians and political pundits are blaming Biden for this inflation THEY ARE LYING TO YOU n n If Biden s spending is causing this inflation why didn t we see inflation rise in when Trump spent EVEN MORE money n n Why did inflation not spike back in March when Biden s only stimulus went out n n Why did inflation rise AFTER the Federal Unemployment benefit was eliminated completely in September And it was already reduced from per week when Trump was president down to per week when Biden took office n n How could Biden s spending with his Infrastructure Bill cause inflation BEFORE any money from it was spent n n Why would inflation rise after Biden REDUCED THE DEFICIT and spent LESS money than Trump n nThe TRUTH is that Biden s spending is NOT THE CAUSE OF THIS INFLATION n nSo what is causing this inflation n nThere are several factors that are causing today s inflation n n When the pandemic hit in we went into lock down Restaurants closed People stopped spending money Demand dropped Manufacturers drastically slowed or even stopped manufacturing part in response to the reduced demand and part in response to the lack of labor due to the people getting Covid and or being quarantined n n When the lock downs ended and people started going back out earlier this year they not only went back to spending money they made up for lost time This created a huge and sudden increase in demand n n Unfortunately increasing supplies is not that simple Our supplier chain is made up of millions of products from all around the globe and many of our larger more complex items have to be manufactured from other parts in the global chain and these manufacturers can t up their output until their suppliers up theirs It s not just the manufacturers that have to ramp back up it s shipping companies trucking companies retailers and everybody in between n n Inflation increases the costs of doing business which in a free market should cause a reduction in corporate profits Yet many large companies showed RECORD PROFITS this year This is because in several large industries there are only a handful of competitors which allows them to raise prices above what a free market would allow and they have used the pandemic and supply chain issues as an excuse to do exactly that n nThe bottom line is that Demand was able to increase much faster than supply THAT along with the corporate manipulation of prices IS WHAT IS DRIVING THIS INFLATION n nP S Let s remember that the President does not control inflation Our economy is based on a free market Absent extreme circumstances he cannot order companies to raise or lower prices or to keep them the same He certainly cannot dictate to foreign companies what they can charge n n

There is no such a thing as finished reform That s one of the reasons why high income countries continuously reform their healthcare systems The countries are in globalized word connected and they tend to inspire each other and similar reforms are often introduced across countries However politicians are keen to get inspired by other countries in a limited way Recent paper offers overview of health reform trends in high income countries before the covid pandemic n n Even before the pandemic countries were facing challenges which persist today The most important challenges are gaps coverage and access concerns about quality integration and continuity of care workforce shortages the epidemiological shift to multiple chronic diseases emerging viral threats as well as other unpredictable exogenous shocks These are the challenges which lie ahead of us and the competent will be forced to willy nilly to deal with it The question is how they are going to do it n n The average age of the population in most developed countries is growing which means that the demand for healthcare will exponentially grow as well The demand in future will concentrate on person centred care n n In the paper were reviewed reforms which were reported in countries in of them went to four clusters insurance cover age resource generation governance healthcare purchasing payment and organization of hospitalcare n n In reforms in countries were reported of them fell under organization of primary ambulatory care governance care coordination specialized care and organization of hospital care n n Most reforms were reported ongoing in implemented seven abandoned Health agency ledreforms were implemented most frequently followed by central government legislated reforms n n Policymakers can leverage international experience of distinct reform approaches addressing similar challenges and similar approaches to address distinct problems Such knowledge may help inspireor support future successful health reform processes

On Feb CDC announced their plan to ease Covid mask guidelines nationally following a sharp decline in Covid cases and death rates since omicron became the predominant variant in America in late Now as states and localities are embracing the CDC s new guidelines and public sentiment continues to turn against Covid restrictions and mandates the shift is serving as a political precursor for President Joe Biden s declaration of victory over Covid in his first State of the Union address on March Regardless of the politics this move is beneficial for Americans Are Democrats trying to save themselves in the midterms by relaxing Covid restrictions like mask mandates n n Biden BIDENSAMERICA covid Democrats cdc
T oo many families are struggling to keep up with their bills Inflation is robbing them of the gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel I get it That was President Joe Biden in his first State of the Union Address on March attempting at least to deflect some of the blame for inflation away from the federal government s unprecedented peacetime spending borrowing and printing avalanche of more than trillion in response to the Covid pandemic That included the trillion CARES Act and billion phase four legislation under former President Donald Trump and the trillion stimulus and billion of new infrastructure spending under President Biden As a result the national debt has increased by trillion to trillion of which the Fed monetized half or trillion by increasing its share of U S treasuries to a record trillion Overall the M money supply has increased by trillion to trillion a whopping percent increase Almost every new dollar of debt was paid for by printing it What more is needed to explain the current bout of inflation Biden doesn t get it This State of the Union was an opportunity to level with the American people If Biden had explained the situation honestly and promised to slow down spending and increase American energy production it could have been an historic pivot that might have saved his Congressional majorities in November Biden is right when says inflation is robbing the American people blind And in they re going to have something to say about it What do you think

Alan Lowe for Palm Coast City Council District n nHere are some bullet points items of my platform followed by a little more detail n n I oppose tax increases n n I support a fiscally responsible government n n I oppose uncontrolled development n n I support development that does not affect adjacent land values n n I oppose zoning changes that will harm adjacent property values n n I support a healthy business atmosphere n n I support government transparency n n I support ensuring there is a quality and detailed cost benefit analysis performed on all significant projects n n I support public town halls at various locations around town to promote public interaction and comment n n I support a third party forensic budget review to identify areas of wasteful spending n nAs your city councilman I will be a public servant and a community leader that actually listens n nNot only will I bring the expected integrity and transparency back to City Hall I will also bring the truth that all city employees whether elected appointed or hired are servants of the people and that the citizens of Palm Coast deserve their respect in all interactions n nI will fight to restore trust City Council of Palm Coast and make your interests my first priority n nI believe in small government and see the government s role as representing the needs of the people and not controlling the public access to information n nI want to serve our city in the best interest of our citizens and lead others by example n nI don t want to play the role of protector but rather one of a civic partner that listens and understands that we need to build an environment of prosperity that attracts people to our city from all walks of life all age groups and instills a sense of pride in living in a community that is willing to evolve to be so much more n nI believe in transparency and creating community interactions by bringing the voice of the people to city hall n nI do believe monthly in person town hall meetings are essential and necessary to keep in close touch with the public to be accessible transparent and present n nI believe that business investments that will create lasting well paid jobs are an essential basis for our city and I am concerned that several important businesses left the city during the past years We need to work on bringing good companies to our city by creating an inviting atmosphere to entice new businesses to call Palm Coast Home I would call for the creation of a committee of local business owners to identify city road blocks to a successful business atmosphere and excessive red tape and then belp devise plans to eliminate them n nWe are all facing economical challenges now more than ever following the Covid lock downs uncontrolled inflation and an uncertain economy and so is the city However I do not believe in raising taxes as the only method to create revenue to fill the city s coffers Instead I believe in creating a thriving business environment to attract investments into our city Tax revenue generated from businesses should help alleviate the pressure of tax dollars gleaned from private residential property tax As such improving the business atmosphere will bring more businesses from which the city can improve the tax base and reduce the burden on the individual n nOUR SHERIFF PARAMEDICS AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS n nSheriff nI support our county Sheriff and his deputies I believe in the work they are doing and their efforts to stem crime and remove drugs from our streets They risk their lives to bring people to justice only to have the courts let them go I have personally witnessed the Sheriff s office close a neighboring drug house and bring the perpetrators to justice n n nParamedics nI have great respect for our paramedics and fire fighting force My mother was very ill and I brought her to our home to take care of her until the end I had to call the paramedics to our home on several occasions They were always prompt courteous and gentile with her As we have an aging community the paramedics are life savers n n nFirefighters nI was here for the fires in the early s and spent a few hours out in the middle of the Pine Lakes golf course to escape the fire Then in I lost my house to the raging forest fires The firefighters did all they could to save as many homes as possible and they fought hard I use to enjoy seeing the events and comments on their Facebook page and will push to get them back online so as to help them be engaged with the community and have a direct link to present information and advertise events n n nMENTAL HEALTH nFlagler County has the dubious honor of having one of if not the highest suicide rates in Florida I experienced this first hand when my father who was diagnosed with dementia took his own life n nAlthough there was no outward sign that he was in trouble he obviously was After he passed friends and family comforted my mom for several days but she we was were then left to our own I believe there should be a city supported outreach program in Palm Coast that reaches out to families affected by these tragedies Even if it is a just a phone call with a friendly voice saying hello how is your day going n nTAXES n I have skin in the game By this I mean that I own property pay property taxes and am keenly aware of the burden increased taxes place upon the community I understand that the government is an entity that survives off of the fruits of other people s labor I will work hard to keep your taxes low and tirelessly look for areas to cut spending eliminate waste and make departments accountable I won t play games pretending a flattened milage rate is a reduction in your property taxes When property values go up the amount paid in property tax with a flat or minimally reduced milage rate still goes up Many of our residents are Senior Citizens who fled the tax drain of other states for the sunshine low taxes and a better life on their fixed incomes We have a responsibility to see to it that Seniors enjoy their retirement without the fear of high taxes and our younger generations have a chance to start without the burden of high taxation holding them back All citizens of Palm Coast deserve a responsible city government n n nA FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT nWhen your bank account gets low you tighten your belt cut out nonessential spending and revise your budget Shouldn t we expect our government to do the same thing It is beneficial for our city to receive grants from the outside but we should not be relying on outside help to soften the impact of bloated spending habits If there is waste then lets find it If there is a better way to achieve the same goals but costs less then lets do it Although we have audits that show the city is on track there are always ways to improve As we enter a time of potential reduced revenue generation for the city we should be reviewing our capital improvements with an eye for delaying or tabling projects that may not be immediately essential

The British family farm could die out in the next years Provided British agriculture stays on the path it s on that may well be the direction we are heading According to data from Defra farms of less than hectares have halved in number in the last years Small holdings have also seen a dramatic decrease too from around in to less than in n nSmall scale family farms are facing an uncertain future putting the future of the sector at risk With increasing concerns over trade deals and the new agricultural bill looming it s an increasingly worrying time for small producers many of whom have shown incredible courage and resilience keeping the country fed through the outbreak of Covid earlier this year n nWhy are Small Scale British Farms Disappearing n nThe number of US style mega farms in the UK has increased by in the past years alone This collapse in family farms has in part been driven by the rise of concentrated animal feeding operations CAFOs In these industrial farming units pigs cows and chickens are crammed by the thousand into rows of barns Many units are semi automated with feeding run by computer with periodic visits by workers n nIndustrial farming dominates animal production and has an outsized influence on crop growing and land usage The UK is now home to at least mega farms classed as CAFOs Most highly geared industrial farms are not far off the CAFO status and there are thousands of industrial farms taking up huge swathes of British land once home to a tapestry of smaller farms n nHow Can we Create a Food System that Supports Small Scale Farms n nThere is extensive evidence of the important role that small scale farms have in our agricultural landscape creating jobs supporting rural communities and reducing inputs and waste on mixed farms n nSmall farms such as these are often written off as inefficient or low output But a study carried out by the Prince s Countryside Fund points out top performing small family farms are just as efficient as many of the country s much larger ones Especially when it comes to producing higher quality food grass fed hand reared free range self sustaining and regenerating n nSecuring a Future for Small Scale Farmers n nWe work directly with around small scale British family farms all who rear native breed meat in harmony with nature Excitingly we are also growing our range to include hundreds of products from many more small scale artisan producers around the country from small scale artisan cheesemakers to family run flour mills growing and milling heritage grains and many many more n nFor us true sustainability also includes building sustainable communities ensuring everyone in the chain is receiving a fair price and that the true cost of our food is being accounted for We aim to enable small family farms to thrive by building strong relationships direct with our customers n nBy shopping with Pipers Farm your money is going back into the community It is helping us to ensure we are able to farm in a way that tackles the climate crisis regenerating rather than depleting our soils It is funding projects such as laying down new hedgerows planting trees improving water cycles and converting to renewable energy It s allowing traditional artisan skills to thrive in rural communities providing important links such as low throughput abattoirs and local feed mills Importantly your support is securing a future for small scale British family farms n nDiscover more at

I wonder if we realize how many problems we are facing that have been caused by government programs and interference As Ronald Reagan once said the nine scariest words are I m from the government and I m here to help The reason we have inflation out of control and a worker shortage is directly tied to the Covid unemployment money and the tax rebates which were necessitated by the government program of shutting down a vibrant and formally free economy which was supposed to only be for two weeks remember The Nurse shortage and high health care costs are directly tied to vaccine mandates Obamacare and out of control government regulations High gas prices Yeah that is tied to sleepy Joe s war on the US s oil and gas industry Inner city violence crime poverty and broken homes Well those are highest in cities with the most government regulation and handouts and it s not even close It s hard to find a serious problem in our world right now that doesn t have the government somehow involved Yet all the time folks keep clamoring for more programs and more so called experts to tell us how to live When will we learn nI do think government can do some things I hold with our founders views however that government is a necessary evil and that limited government is the best government It wasn t a government program that made this country great It was hard working everyday people like you and me You have more wisdom and common sense in your pinkie than in any government bureaucrat How about we take this country back and send a few of them home I think it s high time and always the right time for freedom

In case you ve missed this n nFood Deserts Scarcity in the Land of Plenty nThe phrase food desert may sound like something from a dystopian science fiction movie but living in a food desert is a reality that a surprising number of Americans face every day The term was first coined by the Scottish Nutrition Task Force in and first introduced to the US via the Farm Bill Food Conservation and Energy Act of n nFood deserts are areas that lack access to affordable fresh meats dairy products fruits vegetables whole grains and other foods that make up a healthy diet they are a major factor in overall food insecurity in our nation The USDA defines a food desert as having a poverty rate of or greater and by how close residents are to supermarkets In urban food deserts people live more than a mile away from a supermarket In rural food deserts distance to a grocery store is greater than miles nA USDA report showed that the main characteristics of food desert areas are a very large or very sparse population low income high levels of unemployment inadequate access to transportation and a low number of food retailers providing fresh produce at affordable prices n nFood desert residents usually struggle with a combination of these factors and there are differing schools of thought regarding food deserts and their true effects n nAvailability Accessibility and Affordability Are Issues Or Are They nThe most wide spread thinking holds that residents of food deserts have difficulty juggling availability accessibility and affordability of healthy food to the extent that their health suffers Without ready access to full service supermarkets it can also be difficult for those with dietary restrictions to find appropriate food to fit their cultural or health needs n nEven in cases where healthy food is readily available the cost can be a major barrier for consumers In a comprehensive study was done that compiled data from studies in countries It showed that the cost of healthy food is about more per day than less healthy options which makes for per person per year The total increase for a family of four is over which can be a substantial amount for low income households n nIn the USDA found that million households both lived in a food desert and lacked access to a vehicle Thus the thinking goes even if those people can afford to buy healthy foods it can be difficult for them to get to a grocery store and they may therefore rely more heavily on fast food restaurants and convenience stores n nA paradox exists in urban food deserts amidst a scarcity of healthy food there is a high percentage of obese people due to the increased consumption of less healthy foods The result is a prevalence of obesity and other diet related health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease in those areas A study of Chicago neighborhoods found that deaths from diabetes in food deserts were actually double those in areas with relatively easy access to grocery stores n nConversely a study by the Journal of the American Heart Association JAHA found that association between food deserts and adverse outcomes is largely driven by low area income not poor access to food n nFurther research from New York University NYU showed between and more than a thousand supermarkets opened nationwide in neighborhoods around the country that had previously been food deserts NYU studied the grocery purchases of about households in those neighborhoods While it s true that these households buy less healthy groceries than people in wealthier neighborhoods they do not start buying healthier groceries after a new supermarket opened Instead we find that people shop at the new supermarket but they buy the same kinds of groceries they had been buying before n nIn addition the study also stated the average American travels miles to shop and percent of shopping trips are made by car In fact low income households are not much different they travel an average of miles Since we re traveling that far we tend to shop in supermarkets even if there isn t one down the street Even people who live in zip codes with no supermarkets still buy percent of their groceries from supermarkets n nConsidering that there are countless educational resources for people who wish to learn how to make good dietary choices it would seem that the biggest factor in individual health simply boils down to personal choice This is not to belittle the effects of insufficient nutrition which tends to have the heaviest effect on children in low income areas n nLong Term Effects Go Far Beyond Nutrition nNutrition or the lack thereof affects more than physical health Studies have shown that children who struggle with poor nutrition are more likely to have social and behavioral problems in school This can lead to students dropping out of school and other types of failed education which very often result in economic failures later in life n nThe long term economic cycle in areas deemed to be food deserts are vicious Multi generational families in food deserts tend to experience decreasing wealth which leads to businesses leaving the area which means fewer employment opportunities which leads to even further reduced wealth When new stores open they open in areas of higher income to reduce the risk of their investment The decreased buying power of customers in low income areas and the threat of higher crime rates whether real or perceived tend to push businesses away Some go so far as to label the results food apartheid since food insecurity affects minority groups to a greater degree n nFood Insecurity Most Prevalent in Southern States nIt follows then that the highest concentration of food insecure communities are located in areas with higher populations of minority groups n nThe USDA has calculated that there are total census tracts in the United States which fall within the parameters to be considered a food desert The USDA website states a census tract is a small relatively permanent subdivision of a county that usually contains between and people but generally averages around people Rural counties make up of total counties in the country but they make up of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity n nA December USDA survey showed that of total US households were food insecure with being at low food security status and at very low food security status These percentages account for million people including million children Of those children live in households that experience very low food security n nThis particular survey defined low food insecure households as being able to obtain enough food to mostly maintain their eating patterns or to reduce food intake by eating less varied diets This group was also able to rely on assistance from federal programs and local food pantries n nVery low food security status was defined by having the normal eating patterns of one or more household members disrupted by food scarcity and by cases of overall food intake being reduced due to lack of money and other resources to obtain food n nNo Easy Answers nConsidering the differing schools of thought on the issue is not clear how geographic location truly affects food insecurity or what measures to alleviate it are most effective n nOhio University writes Dealing with food deserts across the United States is a complex issue with no easy solutions It is difficult for communities and cities to simply build more grocery stores develop more transit options or find ways to help individuals generate more income to purchase healthy foods nConversely New York University stated Over the past decade federal and local governments in the United States have spent hundreds of millions of dollars encouraging grocery stores to open in food deserts The federal Healthy Food Financing Initiative has leveraged over billion in financing for grocers in under served areas Meanwhile cities such as Houston and Denver have sought to institute related measures at the local level n nSome mistakenly believe that subsidies for commodities like corn and soy work to lower the prices of foods that are more processed and less healthy Some blame the market driven polices that focus on turning out inexpensive high volume highly processed food products for maximum industry profit One school of thought holds that placing a sin tax on less healthy foods would discourage their purchase n nWhile a variety of programs exist to help with food insecurity they can only do so much especially considering that inflation supply chain issues and food shortages are currently impacting all Americans In fact researchers at Northwestern University found that food insecurity more than doubled because of the covid pandemic affecting up to of households Of course the already precarious situation of millions of food insecure people has been greatly exacerbated by the current state of affairs in our nation n nThrough the tangled web of issues surrounding food insecurity one thing is abundantly clear our nation s food producers are more important than ever

Teacher Retention and Recruitment Our excellent teachers and staff are one of our most valuable resources in education A quality teacher or staff member can make all of the difference between a successful and unsuccessful year for a student However in the last few years our teachers have been asked to do so much They had to switch to online learning at a moment s notice while dealing with technology shortages and lack of home internet This was accomplished with little to no additional training and without additional compensation for the many extra hours of work they gave in addition to their regular work hours Many gave up most of their summer without pay to help create an entirely new world in education Next teachers were tasked with providing both online and in person learning often at the same time even within one class period Our teachers and staff members were literally building the plane while flying it in the air n nThis type of task juggling pushed our teachers and staff past any boundaries they had reached before with technology and learning Simultaneously due to necessary Covid protocols students and teachers were quarantined for over a week when exposed while teaching and learning in person and that had to be factored in to lesson plans Sub shortages only complicated this matter requiring many teachers to work their off periods to cover other classes and teach classes with double the typical number of students to make sure all students had a teacher to supervise them again without additional compensation n nAll the while our teachers were barraged by the politics of Covid infection rates Covid Safety Protocols mask wearing and vaccines They were accused of not wanting to come back to work even of being lazy They were accused of being pro mask or anti mask pro vaccine or anti vaccine n nTo say the least it has been a tough few years and we are seeing record numbers of teachers leave the profession Retaining our best and brightest teachers is of critical importance One of the areas I have looked into is teacher salaries and while we as a district are above average once you have taught in our district for over years our starting salary is lower than many surrounding districts Salaries make up of our district budget I would like to look at ways that our district can be offer competitive salaries to recruit new teachers At the same time offering our existing teachers extra support like the Covid Bonus last year are things that need to be considered By balancing the needs of newer and existing teachers with competitive salaries and compensation we can excel in our goal to employ excellent educators and staff members in our district a primary need to maintain our standing as an excellent district to both work and learn in
This past week Congress received President Biden s trillion budget for a month behind schedule which includes requests for more Covid aid despite states still having billions of unspent federal dollars in their coffers from past stimulus and recovery bills If that is not bad enough the president also seems to have made his calculations assuming that some version of his Build Back Better legislation had passed despite it being stalled in Congress n The president also wants a minimum tax on income and unrealized capital gains for families worth more than million The House passed the MORE Act which would legalize marijuana at the federal level and impose an initial tax on purchases The bill would need votes to break a Senate filibuster where the prospects for passage are not strong Members of the Senate negotiated and agreed to a deal for billion in pandemic aid half the size that the White House requested The lack of funding for international vaccine efforts has angered Democrats and could complicate passage in the House n nRead more in our weekly newsletter gapol ga ga th ga thdistrict gapolitics Congress republican

The future I am predicting is bleak and full of despair nothing but lonely people who are addicted to pleasure and do not have proper role models never feel they have enough and are feeling empty on a day to day basis Never dreaming about anything other then sex sleep work and living day to day while doing drugs and hoping there are not any more disasters Where the average citizen does not care about the rest and when disasters happen everyone just laughs and thinks at least its not me this time People will be angry at themselves and at everyone else idealize money lie cheat steal and whatever it takes to make themselves happy and will rarely do something for someone else or even care Smiles wont be genuine and statements are empty people misunderstand each other and hate each other for reasons taught to them by people they do not know for reasons they don t understand Language will be dumbed down to mostly swear words and slang no one will write or draw or have any hobbies The things in life that make people happy will be things that poison them in the long run and it is accepted as freedom and why not everyone else does it People will ignore the suffering of others on a massive scale while nihilism lack of meaning drug addiction mental health issues crime division racism bigotry materialism egotism lack of education sky rocket to a point society will not function There will be mass shootings so often people will consider it normal People will not be as productive responsible happy genuine kind polite civilized or have any meaning in there life there only dreams will be when they dream at night and people wont want to do better then anyone else and just be average and the world will crumble as problems around the world grow and people continue not to care or do anything about it Humanity has many cancers and among the many are nihilism mental health issues and lack of a moral structure to guide them and make them motivated to treat others good and want to do better in life The antidote is meaning inspiration and love These three things can start to save so many peoples lives and even the world and it starts here It starts now People cannot wait until the world degrades into chaos and there is nothing left The Earth is dying and humanity is killing it and while they are committing murder upon themselves and the Earth many are privileged enough to smile while they do it The world needs people to act as chemo therapy agents and it starts small by helping yourself to those three magic words Everyone needs to wake up and realize that there sleepwalking into killing the world and poisoning themselves People need to learn to care about the right things in life and seek more then just pleasure not because its not ok to be happy but so that others in the future can be happy to Everyone deserves a fair chance and without this generation stepping up to the plate and offering itself as the last generation to be in catastrophic pain then nothing will be done and this crossroads humanity is on will lead to nothing short of a nightmare and that is the best humanity will ever get if people do not do something soon All these issues are a cancer and detriment to humanity and that is even without including war and other global issues like climate change Who will be the doctors if society doesnt produce the humans who naturally want to be doctors let alone good ones What in society makes a human responsible productive polite and civilized What makes people happy non violent non aggresive and willing to never try and offend anyone Being raised properly and having those values instilled in them is needed and a good environment role model group of friends is needed Without these back bones to society people will become so corrupt and toxic it will be hard to imagine life when it was like this Imagine life before covid Imagine what the next disaster will be Imagine the future generations cursing you for not responding to this page sharing it commenting giving your opinions and at least doing something to get healthier be productive find meaning and start bettering yourself a little bit everyday If not for the world then for yourself to die happy and find happiness in life and that in and of itself can save people Dont let society tell you what to do and drag you down Society is like a bad influence friend who always temps you at the wrong times and it is overtaking humanity at an accelerating rate If society were a living being it would be a predator trying to corrupt humanity into needing it and living for it Society can eat you alive and make you love it while it eats you up and spits you out while you make more babies to do the same Society is not your friend it is an enemy to tame and make it work for you Life itself is like an enemy to tame and conquer You must tame life so you can ride through it like a rollar coaster the less you want the less you need the happier you will be and life will become easier and easier as you go Society wants you to want more and never be happy so you buy buy buy These are not theories but facts if you look at history and think about how life was decades ago and how it will look decades from now Humanity does not have decades and something has to be done n nDo you not see something going on with modern life T V entertainment music all getting dumbed down and people caring about life less and less Getting more materialistic Ask yourself why do people want to become doctors and construction workers Why do people want to do anything at all Where do ideas come from What if society does not know why it is How can it be alive if it does not know Humanity is like a hive mind that is dissociative from itself and cannot see its inner working and needs someone or something to take a closer look by stepping back and viewing humanity in a new way no one ever has That is where I come in I am getting humanity down to a science to figure out what makes it tick Why are you the way you are Did T V or entertainment make you better or worse Take a look at the s s s s s etc do you notice anything when it comes to what is accepted as normal Think years into the future and try and do a decade at a time what do you see Do you see things getting better or worse Society has a cancer no one knows lying dormant and that is the degrading values and productivity of its people Inspiration is on a decline and who will want to be the doctors mechanics firefighters Who will be the psychologist Who will run society What is going to happen if the world produces humans who just want to be the average and never strive for anything and become dumb and addicted Nihilism is an enemy and a cancer laying dormant I am not your average in this universe I can teach you many things these are questions to think about You may want to reconsider you statements about me This is all without even including the issues in the world such as war poverty drug addiction mental illness which is on the rise Humanity is sick and needs a doctor I am that doctor n nMy point is society is corrupting itself and not noticing the effects it is having or the significance of what is going on Modern life is a risk to humanity in the sense people will get dumb and addicted Like humans are domesticating themselves and will not have someone to keep things running for them n nIf you want friends in the future who do not drag you down you must join my community and start building something to last Do you think it is ok to die of cancer or heart disease What about finding new hobbies Sometimes people need other people to be around to get into new hobbies and like them Spice is the variety of life and people need a proper balance and humanity is getting out of whack This is not a cult or anything that can hurt anyone I am looking for people who understand me and would wish to better themselves and help me spread my message My message is that everyone must better themselves little bits at a time and when I say better I mean find hobbies things to inspire you practice time management and try to orient your life in a way that can help you your family friends and even future generations so that you can feel apart of something This is something fundamental to humans feeling apart of a group and having something to look forward too in order to make the pain and sacrifices during the day worth it and inspire people to keep going through life and not give up Giving up is what most going to be doing and I want to start now to build a community that wont let that happen Having friends that are like family that can all share ideas and common goals and try to save humanity themselves and future generations The Earth is not sustainable like this and neither is humanity This is the last stand humanity has and the most important century humanity has ever had and people are sleepwalking right when humanity needs to do something Like taking a nap during a fire alarm and falling asleep at the wheel All humans no matter what race gender identity culture religion etc must put there differences aside and realize there is no need to be divided when unification is what the planet needs For you your family and for your great great grandchildren Viewing future generations and even ancestors as living entities are a great way to inspire change and motivation in humanity What if your ancestors knew what you were doing Or weren t doing Would your great great grandparents not be shocked at what the world is like and how it corrupted it has gotten Would they not want you to get better be inspired be motivated to take on the world and die happy You must learn to live with less or aim for something higher and do whatever it takes to get it What do you want in life What is life to you Who do you want to be Why do you want what you want Why do you want to be what you want to be Who gave you those ideas Are those ideas and dreams really what you want Is there any room for improvement Is your goals and aims in life good for not only you but humanity Do you really want to be another statistic or number on a chart or do you want to be a part of something bigger then life itself I am working on finding a way to mathematically find an equation to sustain a proper balance from studying wisdom from all around the world and throughout history What can make a human happy as often as possible with out getting addicted to pleasure or getting in the way of others Humans must learn not effect others and harm them at the very least of what they choose to do with there life as human freedom should be a number one cause of this community What is freedom Why do you think freedom is what it is Are your ideas your own or are you letting others think for you Are you ready to make a change and start bracing for impact A mass epidemic of nihilism is approaching and when it hits it will hit harder then a hurricane of addiction mental illness crime and unhealthy behaviors leading to people feeling alone empty and having no meaning and pleasure in life These are some of the societal ruptures I talk about in my material and this is a dormant laying cancer humanity has and humanity needs a proper balance You might be happy now but what about years how do you see yourself Your family The world What is happiness How can someone find the best ways to maximize happiness and manifest it in a way that it will spread to everyone around them What produces the most happiness in life without drugs addictions negative behaviors and bad influences around What can inspire people to change and realize how important they might be to something larger n nHave you ever wanted to be a part of something larger then life itself Something that will stand the test of time something that will be on every bill board commercial signs on sidewalks something that will be in movies and remembered forever Do you want to be remembered forever To be part of something that changed history and saved the world by waking people up to the dangers of the century Things wont get better for you unless you do it on your own and the same goes for humanity I want to make society stop poisoning itself

Democrats always blowing smoke up our butts Trying to change what our country was founded on based on their irrational ideas It is time we took a stand If Elected in State House I m committed to protecting the people s rights of Alabama No we are not going to accept their irrational ideas that infringe on our rights No we are not restricting our nd Amendment rights nor are we going to allow them to go after ammunition restrictions and gun components restrictions as their back door attack We are going to protect the unborn abortion is not the cure Instead of expanding abortion clinics let us expand the education and support services programs to young mothers who are going through a pregnancy crisis We are going to Protect our Religious freedom stop using Covid pandemic measures to restrict our churches During the height of the pandemic we could squeeze three hundred people in an airplane and go play golf but yet public assemblies like churches were forbidden Does that make any logical sense We need to teach our kids the core and moral character values of life that we have lost in our schools Alabama is the th in the nation for highest divorce rate over divorces a year There is something morally wrong with our society when you are celebrating your parents or grandparents year anniversary but yet you are going through your nd or rd divorce If you have been in a marriage there are always going to be good and bad times Isn t that what we acknowledge in wedding vows How many remember them I take thee to be my wedded husband wife spouse to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part So couples now give up on each other so easily in today s society if you have been in marriage I can assume you have had disagreements or arguments sometimes You might have had an argument you said something to one another in the heat of the moment and it escalates quickly What is the first word that always gets said during the argument Divorce It s like an atomic bomb of words but it is the first word to get said Out of the divorces less than will try to seek professional help Is our government trying to reduce those numbers or trying to accommodate those numbers You can always accommodate a problem without any effort to fix or reduce a problem For example we could continue accommodating the problem by hiring more judicial judges and more judicial administrative staff to keep up with the problem which costs more taxpayers more and more money as the problem grows We can display large ads offer legal services for to get you out of marriage but that is not going to reduce the numbers We could provide a service of outreach to educate struggling married couples an open ear to the problems that are happening That might just find a compromise of keeping them united instead of destroying what they have together Are we going to save every marriage absolutely not but we can make sure they are making the right choice I ask for your support and vote May th

I wrote to the Greenock Telegraph in March about my concerns that not all school children had devices despite the promises of the Scottish Government to provide them Here is our press release nLiberal Democrats demand Sturgeon delivers on online learning pledges Inverclyde Liberal Democrats are increasingly concerned about the growing gap in educational attainment and educational access in Inverclyde At the end of last year the SNP government chose to redistribute the million fund set aside for the poorest pupils in the Challenge Authorities and shared it equally between all authorities This pot had been an attempt to close the ever increasing attainment gap and its removal was a slap in the face for equal opportunities and fairness nThis was following on from two years of educational disruption due to the pandemic where wealthier families were able to offset some of the difficulties of home schooling by having access to the internet laptops and other devices However for many poorer families who did not even have one device to share nor internet access the disruption to their children s education was catastrophic When home schooling became mandatory in the lockdown the SNP government did not supply laptops to children who were without them nDr Jacci Stoyle who is a former teacher and current Inverclyde Lib Dem council candidate said n In March Nicola Sturgeon promised devices for every school child to help tackle the digital divide I am totally shocked that two years since the start of the pandemic the SNP Government still hasn t sorted out providing devices and internet access for children from poorer backgrounds Nicola Sturgeon s pre election promise has failed to materialise n The use of online devices for delivering the curriculum has become normal practice even for young children Primary teachers with pupils as young as five have been providing homework tasks reading books and other material online How is this fair if not every child has access to these critical learning tools n We know that pupils are still absent due to Covid isolations online access is critical during these periods to allow pupils to keep in touch with their teachers Local families deserve better nInverclyde schools have recently sent out a survey offering a loaned device but have no opportunities to facilitate online access The communication reads n Inverclyde Community Learning and Development CLD have a number of laptops they can loan to families who need support with technology at home Unfortunately they cannot support access to the internet at the moment If you feel your family could benefit from this and you meet CLD criteria then please fill out the form below Thanks nDr Stoyle said n This really isn t good enough and I call upon Stuart MacMillan MSP to make good the promise which the First Minister made in March last year
A new generation of local parent organizations had begun to emerge in public education in the years before the pandemic groups more interested in school quality and educational equity than bake sales many of them led by people of color The Covid crisis quickened the movement turning kitchen tables into classrooms and stoking parents frustrations with school closings and the education they watched live And the pandemic spawned another strand of parent organizations pursuing cultural conservatism Read more in our latest report

All We Get Are Warnings n nIt is no secret that we are living in troubled times Our southern border is an unmitigated disaster with millions worldwide flowing into the country illegally The Biden Administration and Federal Reserve have created an economic disaster where they are leveraging the future to infinity while blaming the skyrocketing inflation on supply chains and Russia Failed public schools attack religious liberties while spreading critical race lies and Marxist ideology The weakest administration in history is simply incapable of dealing with the challenges Instead they attempt to manage every crisis after it hits with reckless incompetence The much needed leadership is nonexistent and as the situation of every crisis worsens all we get are warnings one after another n nBiden warns gas prices will go up then tells the reporter to blame Putin Buttigieg recommends buying an electric vehicle We are told to expect cyber attacks and that we should ensure proper firewalls are in place Hypersonic missiles nuclear weapons chemical attacks nothing is off the table with Putin and we must be prepared for the worst NATO is at risk World War III is one shot away And of course there is Fauci with his never ending COVID mantra Every news cycle brings another warning Americans are desperate for leadership and all they get is incompetence n nWashington has become the new Captain Obvious Our houses are flooding and they say it is going to rain Always a day late and a dollar short But not a single remedy not a sliver of leadership not a shred of a plan that might prevent or even predict a disaster We must settle for platitudes stupid excuses and political propaganda that rivals even the most totalitarian governments America is still the greatest nation on Earth but it is not easy to remain optimistic n nThere is a way out however but we will have to be vigilant and patient We must send the right people to Washington Take back the House and Senate this year and then lay the final brick of normalcy by taking back the White House in In the meantime we plan push back and persevere It is their America or ours I vote for ours VoteMerk com

I love talking with my friend Pat because he s full of surprising wisdom and he really helps me think things though sometimes n nOnce after a session where Pat had effortlessly given me a number of useful insights I thanked him and asked him if he had any problems or worries of his own Pat mused for a moment and then said Well if I could take even half of my own advice I d have millions of dollars and be president Or at least be able to calmly turn down the job offer n nWhy are we so bad at listening to our own wisdom sometimes n nI thought of that again when I stumbled across the text of an interview I gave a couple of years ago for another friend of mine who teaches philosophy classes The interview was from the year B C as in Before Covid It was given just before the pandemic came along to turn everything upside down Another time another age n nI felt like I d received a gift from the past And shockingly I had sent it to myself like a time capsule n nReading that interview from two years was like tuning in to a transmission from a calmer time A calmer Tim That too I was clearly in a good place B C and able to reflect More grounded more centered all the things we ve lost since the roaring s sprang on us like a famished lion on a dazed wildebeest n nI wish I would have looked back on these words a few times a day during this rough ride they might have helped reel me in a little and might have been more productive than watching The Queen s Gambit for a third time Well better late than never n nMy friend asked me this What is the purpose of a human being n nMy reply I think you can find a way to be kind A kindness for yourself and a kindness that will lead to helping others I can t think of a better purpose I think it sounds deceptively simple It s not just I ll open the car door for you I m talking about a deeper kindness to not respond to our worst reflexes To offer a genuine hand to someone based on the fact that you know that the practice of kindness will enrich I believe there s no stronger energy that can link itself to other people than the energy of kindness n nI see people who embody that and I envy them I want to be more like that and for that day and even for a week I do a pretty good job because I saw it happen and that reminds me I need more of that to bring me to a better place and space and a better way of thinking and living and doing I speak with a forked tongue because I m amazingly selfish in many ways but I try to balance that n nMy friend asked me if seeing an example of kindness and wanting to emulate it was related to education somehow n nMy answer Oh yes There are two types of educators There are educators who like to measure and there are educators who like to teach And I find that a very clear divide Kindness is not measuring Why do we want children to compete against each other and why are we measuring them I find it to be a great enemy of free thinking an enemy of kindness of mentorship of coaching I find it an enemy of love This incessant need to only measure as a way to define someone s capability that is a box a trap that is a cage around a young mind that has yet to experiment fail flourish and conquer and fail again and conquer again and that is a crime against minds That is deeply unkind n nAnother thing I talked about in the interview was not letting fear doubt and uncertainty hold you back n nAs a dyslexic and someone whose primary way of learning is through people when I was in college I still remember the Psychology class I took It was a person lecture hall and every time the teacher would say something I didn t understand I would raise my hand I raised my hand so often people booed Can you imagine being a freshman in college and being booed And you know what I kept my hand up I paid for my seat I know how I learn I got an A in that class Raise your hand and don t be afraid of the boos n nTo which I would add Also don t boo others when they re trying to learn We all learn at different paces and in different ways These are turbulent times but if we ve learned nothing else from the past two years it should be the value of patience and helping each other move forward As for me I m going to try to do more listening to others as well as to my better self

Understanding massive spreadsheets with hundreds of stats s amounts and cross referencing between past yrs and next yr s proposed figured can be daunting I certainly appreciate the Admin s handy graphs in some of the pdfs Below I tried to put things in a simple layperson s language so I hope my breakdown of next year s budget will help parents and community members understand what the Board is considering how much once in a lifetime federal Covid we re getting and the funding losses we re being hit with etc n n The BOE is set to vote on the Budget officially tomorrow at p It s a public meeting and anyone can come in person or via Zoom n nHere s the low down and of course as disclaimers seem to be required these are my personal opinions in reading all the budget docs and sitting through extensive money talks since January The following are my notes as a School Bd member and I neither speak on behalf of the TOSDBOE nor am I authorized to do so n n we re losing students every year but the costs to educate the public school students we have is increasing as it does all over the country n we ve lost MILLIONS in state aid since n The cost to run the district for next yr is slated to be almost m and that s UP or m from this past yr we re getting of that from an almost standard property tax increase read below and an extra is from us dipping into our reserve accounts to equalize things also read below n Next yr we re getting m in local property tax money that s of our budget n We re getting m from the state that s almost of our budget n We re taking out of our Capital reserve and k out of our maintenance reserve to snag that extra cost increase we don t have the funds for kinda like dipping into savings if you will n nWhat does this essential mean We must raise the school tax levy this will raise an additional m part of the m in total n The avg OT homeowner w a k house and yes this is apparently the average house cost these days as we all know real estate in parts of town has skyrocketed will see taxes go up next yr due to this school tax increase Incidentally this has roughly been the same increase for the last few yrs averaging to since n All the staff principal asks were more than m which in a perfect world would ve been awesome to grant But of course we couldn t fiscally do that n nSome good stuff in the past yr or so to celebrate nNew elementary Social Studies program nNew electives at TOIS nMore Academic Coaching Staff Interventionists nBCBA Board Certified Behavior Analyst and Behaviorist we need n nBUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN to your CHILD IN SCHOOL n The impacts are nHigher Class Sizes nCuts in Programs French Elementary Italian nNo Dedicated Pre K Supervisor nTeacher movement within District nNo Switch computer tech upgrade for Administration Building nNo upgrade to the Pre K Playgrounds n nWhat does Teacher movement within District mean Several teachers are leaving mostly through retirement thank you all you re amazing The district could post their jobs and hire new staff OR we could move people from one building to another to fill those suddenly vacant classroom spots THIS IS IS SLATED to happen the most at OTES classroom teachers per the Supt will be transferred out of Dow School Less staff in general will result in classroom sizes growing primarily at elems ie some classrooms that enjoyed kids may see kids next yr Other classroom aides will switch buildings too As of the last mtg the Supt reported nhe didn t foresee any job losses that s great n nWhy is everything so expensive nTranspo costs have increased we re required to buy new buses as some of ours are aging out nBenefits have increased nSupport staff we ve increased staff s n nSome funding explanations nESSER COVID related M nEsser COVID related M nCares Act COVID related k n We ve also been great about applying and winning smaller grants Yay n nAccording to tomorrow s public budget presentation here are some increase and decreases in recent and projected budgets n n nSchool Sponsored Athletics Instruction n n nBefore After School Programs n n nBasic Skills Remedial Instruction n n nSpecial Ed allocation down n nSummer school n n nOT students to charter schools n n nTextbooks n n nSalaries wages nXxx n nThe proposed budget keeps the status quo it does offer little program creation and expansions to combat gaping learning loss since the pandemic started and to initiate creative ideas for greater educational equity We re planning to spend more than m on the aging HVAC system at the middle school whole project and we re allocating large chunks of the Fed Covid funds to pay for it nBig Capitol Improvement projects for NEXT YR nHVAC PROJECT TOIS nREPLACE CURTAIN WALL PART OF HVAC PROJ TOIS nROOF REPLACEMENT WAYSIDE n nThe administration worked hard to move funds around and initially we had a budget shortfall of about m and at last couple of meetings they worked out creative ways to knock down a million n nA lot of the budget is math but much is also WHAT s AVAILABLE and WHAT s POSSIBLE n nIt is not easy or cheap to provide a stellar education I hope residents and parents attend tomorrow s meeting present questions or comments and also are proactive in demanding more fair state funding Please reach out to elected officials to ask for assistance More to come on that in the coming weeks from BOE president n nDid you know Here s what it costs to educate Ocean students nSpend per student nOTHS k nTOIS nOTES nWANA nWAY n nok all above is A LOT to take in but hopefully it s easier than massive

Broadband Internet nA topic that is hurled out there every election cycle is what are you going to do to bring jobs to this county The question seems to have been dwarfed this cycle by flooding and traffic congestion however here s a thought n nOur Federal Government has gone off the deep end with making inadequate and irresponsible legislation making us conservatives nervous as to what the future will hold The cost of living is rising faster than our wages People are scrambling to find ways to save their wages in order to keep up with inflation n nOf all the programs that are on the horizon to be forced upon us one may be useful n nI am speaking of broadband internet service As we went through COVID we saw a great swing to work from home opportunities I have been speaking with people who are happy about working from home and enjoying benefits such as spending more time with family saving money by curbing commuting expenses and raises they have achieved by working jobs that are outside the county and sometimes out of state jobs that were otherwise unavailable due to physical location This could be the solution to our families concerns Those concerns being their children are leaving and not returning because there are too few well paying jobs n nBroadband internet would also benefit rural college students whose parents are making sacrifices to ensure their children can excel in a competitive job market Because most classes and supporting software run off highspeed internet these students are having to drive to locations with faster internet sources to study such as Starbucks Panera Bread or Whataburger n nBroadband will also open doors by allowing uninterrupted video class meets and faster material uploads for online schools certifications or accreditations in a number of fields which can lead to advancement in a current job or better jobs in fields they are passionate about I know this personally n nCurrently rural businesses within our county are struggling with the lack of dependable internet connectivity Examples of these struggles include the inability to run a debit credit card machine at our local rural businesses and cell phone hotspots that are not reliable enough for a debit credit card machine either Losing connections can delay invoicing ordering and causes miscommunication which is detrimental to independent businesses located throughout our beautiful county n nAnother sector affected by unreliable internet connectivity is home based employees An example is those who work for Navy Federal one of the area s largest employers of at home based employees that pays above average wages Employees have expressed the fear and frustration of always having to explain to Navy Federal that the internet was awful and unreliable while praying daily that Navy Federal continues to have patience with them Based on my observation of the housing market climbing so rapidly over the last two years I do not believe that the solution is sell out and move into town after all there are no houses in town to move to n nWith the addition of broadband not only could it make stable these examples and more like them but it could also lead to a more technical workforce living and spending their income here in our county Possibly a much better scenario is it promotes families to live in a slower country setting allowing them to focus more on the family and find the joy we already know n nDuring my trip to Greenville SC a friend was showing me how their community took its abandoned textile factories and rundown buildings to re invent the city s town life Local investors using their money invested in their town and attracted a younger tech driven crowd This crowd successfully changed and bred new life into a gloomy depressed part of town n nWith the state jockeying a position to receive million dollars or more this seems to have some promise in making some positive influences in our beloved county This is just something to work towards with the help of us all

Campaign funding tallies in tens of thousands nBy Mitchell Kirk Daily R eportermkirk greenfieldreporter com nApril n nHANCOCK COUNTY Tens of thousands of dollars are backing campaigns in the upcoming primary election including from residents candidates themselves and companies doing business with county government n nReports due earlier this month document campaigns contributions and expenditures dating back to the beginning of the year n nMarc Huber a Republican seeking reelection for his Hancock County Board of Commissioners District seat came into the reporting period with nearly and tallied nearly more in contributions n nHuber who s running for a third term on the board of commissioners said his campaign had a couple fundraisers in preparation for next week s election n n That s usually what we ve always done in the past he said We ve had some corporate people invest in our campaign and we ve had local people invest in it as well n nAmong those corporate contributors are companies and executives of companies with speculative warehouse developments in western Hancock County including from Columbia South Carolina based Red Rock Developments and each from Carmel based Lauth John Bumgarner of Cincinnati based Al Neyer and Ryan Gallmeyer of Indianapolis based Ambrose Property Group n nHuber has supported much of the speculative warehouse development in the western part of the county but not all He voted against the creation of a special taxing district last year to facilitate a Red Rock Developments project citing a lack of assurances that it would benefit public safety and schools The commissioners have since adopted a practice of entering into economic development agreements with warehouse developers that outline tax breaks as well as payments for operational public safety and school purposes n nLaw firms and lawyers involved in the western developments have contributed to Huber s campaign as well including from Matthew Price of Dentons Indianapolis office and another from an investment company he runs from Barnes Thornburg s Indianapolis office and from Briane House of Greenfield based Pritzke Davis n nDustin Frye of Fishers based RQAW which is leading construction on the county s soon to open new jail contributed to Huber s campaign n n It s not that uncommon Huber said If you look at anybody s campaign financing people that work for the county and do things for the county they tend to contribute It s not a payoff n nIndiana Rep Chris Jeter R Fishers whose district includes part of northwestern Hancock County contributed to Huber s campaign as well n nGary McDaniel a Republican Greenfield City Council member looking to replace Huber came into the reporting period with nearly and raised another His backers include fellow city council members George Plisinski and Mitch Pendlum as well as Ray Richardson who served as county attorney for years before the board of commissioners replaced him in n nDavid Clapper and Sandra Hudson western county residents and outspoken critics of the development there also supported McDaniel n nMcDaniel has been critical of that development as well arguing that the infrastructure in that area is lacking for such large complexes n n It s unbelievable that we can go at something this unprepared he said I hope to work with the other commissioners and we can step back for a minute and see what we can do to make the lives of the taxpayers better n nMore focus needs to be placed on residential development in the western part of the county McDaniel said n nMuch of Republican incumbent Hancock County Prosecutor Brent Eaton s campaign coffers consists of a loan of over from himself He said he started setting money aside more than a year ago n n Had to tighten the belt a little bit around the house and that s just the way it is Eaton said n nHe noted COVID risks that persisted through the winter made it challenging to hold fundraising events n n It was very difficult to have the type of in person events which have been the lifeblood of campaign fundraising in the past he said n nGrey Chandler a Republican looking to replace Eaton reported over in contributions much of which from family and himself He also reported a loan from himself to his campaign n n I like the idea that I don t owe anybody any favors he said I m not saying other candidates who fund raise would feel that way but I think it s a lot easier when there s no issues like that I certainly accepted donations from those who reached out and wanted to give but I didn t make serious fundraising efforts n nChandler a former Madison County deputy prosecutor added he s reached out to lawyers he s had good relationships with in the past for donations but has yet to hear back n nAlong with candidates seeking office a public question is also on the ballot for voters in the Mt Vernon Community School Corporation district regarding a new property tax of up to cents per of assessed value from through as late as School officials say the tax is needed as a decade long funding boost allowed by the state draws to a close and as property tax caps continue to limit revenue available to schools It comes as the school corporation embarks on an expansion to keep up with its projected student population growth that includes building a new elementary school n nA committee advocating for the tax increase has raised over for its campaign including from Mt Vernon staff and school board members as well as from the Indiana Kentucky Ohio Regional Council of Carpenters n nMike McCarty a former Mt Vernon school board member and co chair of the Mt Vernon Community Growing Stronger Together committee said even more important than raising funds for the committee has been raising awareness about the needs for the tax increase throughout the school district Chief among those needs he continued is maintaining competitive pay for teachers to ensure the school corporation doesn t lose them and making sure class sizes don t get too big n n Schools are the centers of our communities McCarty said n nAttempts to reach the Indiana Kentucky Ohio Regional Council of Carpenters for comment were unsuccessful McCarty did not want to speak on their behalf but said he s grateful for the group s support n n They re part of the community somehow and feel very strongly obviously he said n nBill Bolander the incumbent Republican Hancock County Council member representing District in the southwestern part of the county reported a sole campaign contribution consisting of a loan from himself n n I ve always funded it myself pretty much said Bolander who s in his sixth term on the council n nBolander added he received a contribution from the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors but that it s yet to be deposited He thinks that support stems from his advocacy for higher residential design standards as the council s representative on the Hancock County Area Plan Commission n nScott Wooldridge a Republican looking to replace Bolander came into the reporting period with nearly and raised another n nAlong with McDaniel s campaign Clapper also contributed to Wooldridge s Wooldridge has been critical of the development surge in the western part of the county as well The county council can influence that development via tax abatements something Wooldridge feels Bolander and other council members have been too generous on Wooldridge thinks abatements could be scrutinized more and last shorter durations n n We need to do the people s work and not just our own agendas he said n nClapper a commercial real estate analyst said he supports McDaniel because of his desire to pause on industrial development and think more about residential development and supports Wooldridge because of his promise to put constituents feelings over his own n n I m not against development but it s got to be development that makes sense Clapper said n nJeannine Gray the incumbent Republican Hancock County Council member representing council District came into the reporting period with over and raised another Her opponent Scott Ruble reported an in kind contribution of over to his campaign from his business Ruble Outdoor Concepts Inc

Re election Announcement nMayor Angie Devanney nApril n nIt s been a trying and difficult few years n nLike many of you there were times that I struggled with so much unknown in the early days of Covid I found strength and inspiration from many places namely my family my mamas Liza Viana with her own struggles my Town hall staff I love you guys with all my heart and Father Andy Prachar who supported me in times of weakness even though I am not Catholic He coined a phrase that will forever send me right back into the memory of those early months of the global pandemic He called that feeling Leadership Tired At the end of the day we all felt the weight the heaviness of the Covid crisis plus the exposure of the wound that social and racial injustice caused all bubbling to the surface simultaneously n nMy family sacrificed While most families were reconnecting over dinner playing board games and cooking together the Devanneys were surviving off of square take out meals a day a mother and wife who spent her time on emergency management calls with the state county and local level until all hours of the day and missing a mom s stabilizing force There were high school graduations proms championship games and dance recital never held A sadness for loss of it all My husband George forged forward and ran our business without me never complaining n nI share these very personal moments because as we emerge from the Covid crisis I had uncertainty about running for re election Not because I don t love the job the hard work and the connection to this community because I most certainly do It was because my family gave selflessly so I could take care of our residents n nWe all are witnessing that Berkeley Heights is in the midst of change Many important projects cultural events and planning will shape what this community will become in the future My local county state and federal relationships my ability to get things done has kept us safe and is helping us grow Recently I had an epiphany this is not the time for a hiatus but rather a time to lean in fully after Covid derailed what we are capable of evolving into as a community n nJust a few highlights come to mind Working with Congressman Malinowki to bring to Berkeley Heights to address the aging infrastructure and drainage issues plaguing the Township Lobbying Union County to ensure the Berkeley Caterers project becomes the gateway jewel of our community providing passive recreation and walking trails along the Passaic Driving innovative ways to fund the redevelopment of Peppertown Park to be the gem of our downtown Negotiating with Fiserve to bring in in funding for the lower Columbia Park development initiative started by volunteers n nTaking care of our seniors by completing vaccine registrations Recording regular robo calls that still take place today so our older adults who may not access technology can easily stay informed Creating a senior survey to ensure that every older resident has a voice in the activities through the creation of a Senior Advisory Committee because Berkeley Heights seniors want to age in place n nRespecting our first responders at the highest level Office of Emergency Management fire and the rescue squad Appointing our new police chief who will continue the work of emphasizing community policing Bringing senior programs like the Mobile Vehicle Commission MVC to the BHPD the parking lot at town hall so our seniors don t have to travel Fighting for accreditation through our municipal insurance company to help to give our police department the tools they need Working with our Mayor s Youth Council to offer self defense training for young women n nCreating an Economic Development Committee that provided support for businesses during shut down Launching a Technical Review Committee to help starting a business in Berkeley Heights easier Passing the creation of an entertainment zone that makes Berkeley Heights a destination Pushing for improvements like green space and biking walking paths in downtown to grow the restaurant and other industries that will service the new residents moving into that area n nKeeping a mindful eye on the finances Hiring a Financial Planner to track debt pay down debt and maintain our financial health Dedicating reserves for snow sewer debt services and more Pushing to ensure redevelopment projects stay on track so that our affordable housing agreement would not be jeopardized and we can pay down the debt on the municipal complex plus permanently finance our debt n nCreating a welcoming community where everyone feels a part of Berkeley Heights Passing a permanent committee the Truth Community Healing Committee Celebrating everyone s culture through community flag raisings events Planning a multicultural street fair in the fall Assessing our diversity and inclusion in Town hall and our commissions and boards n nAdmittedly there were a few groans on Cornell Avenue when I discussed the importance to me of continuing my work in the Township But I know I have the love and support of my family to ensure I keep Berkeley Heights on the forefront n nSo it is with great pride I launch my campaign for re election We have much more to do Berkeley Heights I m looking forward to us all doing it together After all we are better together

If Environmental and Animal Extremist Groups Get Their Way What Will Our Pets Eat n nAs pet owners our dogs and cats are important to us in so many ways One of the most basic and important parts of caring for pets is feeding them Therefore it is important to consider where pet food comes from and what will happen if there is no food available to feed them That could be a real crisis if animal and environmental extremists manage to get their way and animal agriculture were to cease n nIncreased Pets Means Increased Need for Pet Food n nAccording to the American Pet Products Association pet ownership increased to about up from in The Wall Street Journal reported that pet food sales grew almost in the year ending November compared to for food overall Pets and their food are big business So how do we meet the needs of our pets n nThis is where animal proteins and products that aren t utilized by humans come in n nAnimal Byproducts in Pet Food n nPet foods use rendered animal ingredients and by products for pet food These ingredients are not only healthy but improve the sustainability of the pet food industry animal agriculture and add in valuable nutrients n nAt the American Feed Industry Association s AFIA Pet Food Conference in January of the head of food safety quality and regulatory for Pilgrims JBS USA Ansen Pond Ph D provided a detailed account of the sustainable benefits of rendering to the pet food industry n nThese benefits included significant contributions n To reduce animal protein fat and byproduct waste n Repurpose water n Reduce greenhouse gas emissions GHG n Provide fresh meat slurry ingredients to pet food processors n n nEverything But the Moo Oink and Cluck n nAnimal agriculture has a saying that they use everything but the moo or oink or cluck In the U S meals containing different meat and cuts comprise of only a portion of a livestock animal n nThe raw materials from the animals processed are recaptured and repurposed in many industries including pet food where essential amino acids and fatty acids are valuable for pet nutrition n nRoughly of raw materials from cattle from poultry and from swine are considered inedible in the U S market for human food Rather than going to waste those products are used for numerous products ranging from pet food to asphalt suture material gelatin capsules paint make up pharmaceutical products and many many more n nWater Used for Irrigation is a Valuable Byproduct of Animal Processing n nWater used for irrigation is a valuable byproduct of animal agriculture and animal processing When livestock are rendered water is removed from animal byproduct ingredients The water is collected as condensate and then renderers treat and repurpose that water for use in irrigation This equates to billion gallons billion pounds of water released back into the environment every year To put it into perspective that equates to about Mississippi Rivers n nReplacing Animal Protein and Fat Ingredients with Vegan Alternatives is Not Sustainable n nAlmost daily animal and environmental groups are pushing for fake vegan products which are simply not sustainable nor healthy The reality is this if pet food producers were to replace animal protein and fat ingredients which are by products of human food production with vegan alternatives they d have to plant and harvest an additional million acres of soybeans and million acres of corn That doesn t even take into account the additional water needed to grow those crops n nGuardian Article About Vegan Dog Food n nOn April th The Guardian published an article claiming that a peer reviewed study from the University of Winchester proves that vegan diets are healthier for dogs than commercial diets The facts are that no veterinary nutritionists advocate for vegan dog food UNLESS they are formulated by a licensed veterinary nutritionist and there are no other alternatives Cats simply cannot subsist on a vegan diet even though there are those vegans who believe they can A vegan diet for cats is inhumane causing the cat to suffer from malnutrition and a horrible death n nIt is important to note that The Guardian has received numerous grants to write against animal agriculture Therefore it comes as no surprise to find numerous flaws in the so called study and subsequent claims The researchers of the study are vegan and motivated by bias None of the researchers who participated in the study are veterinary nutritionists Most glaring is the fact that the study was funded by the food awareness organization ProVeg International n nThe study itself was based on pet owner responses It was sent to pet owners who were the only ones giving input Their pets veterinarians had no input According to the study of the dogs were fed a conventional meat diet were fed a raw meat diet and were fed a vegan diet over the period of one year nThere were no challenges given in the study either which is a basic part of scientific research The numbers vegan and raw diet are not representative of the general population Additionally the Guardian article glossed over the fact that according to the study raw fed dogs were healthier than vegan dogs n nByproducts Are NOT Bad for Pets n nAnimal byproducts are a sustainable and nutritious way to meet the needs of our pets Anthropomorphizing our pets can compromise their health according to Dr Sean Delaney a veterinary nutritionist from Davis CA Dr Delaney has gone on record as stating that dogs and cats are evolutionarily hardwired to consume the livestock leave behinds that we find disgusting feet eyes brains etc He further states that these byproducts are quite nutritious for animals Watch a cat eat a mouse and they go for the vital organs because these have the vital nutrients they need as obligate carnivores Unfortunately the ever increasing shift from agrarian to urban population has changed the way society looks at ingredients for pet food often to the detriment of the pet as in the case of imposing a vegan diet on animals that need meat to be healthy n nRegulation of Pet Food and Pet Food Safety n nPet food products are among the most highly regulated products in grocery stores Federal and state laws and regulations apply to various aspects of pet food including ingredients manufacturing processes and labeling Pet food plants are subject to inspection by the FDA and state regulators both state control officials and FDA have the authority to test pet food ingredients and the finished product n nPet food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration FDA The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FD C Act requires that all animal foods like human foods be safe to eat produced under sanitary conditions contain no harmful substances and be truthfully labeled In addition canned food must be processed in conformance with the low acid canned food regulations to ensure it is free of viable microorganisms Title Code of Federal Regulations Part n nPet food labeling is regulated at two levels the FDA regulations require proper identification of the product net quantity statement name and place of business of the manufacturer or distributor and proper listing of all the ingredients from most to least based on weight In addition the Association of American Feed Control Officials AAFCO provide a model of regulations that states can follow n nAnimal Sourced Byproducts n nAAFCO s Model Regulations for all animal feeds require that the ingredients list include the species of animal that meat and meat byproducts come from unless the meat or meat byproducts come from cattle swine sheep or goats n nDuring the processing of animals certain parts rejected for human use can be expected to be processed into animal feed This could be meat that doesn t meet human aesthetics or internal organs Meat and meat by products from animals that have diets by other means than slaughter aren t directly suitable for animal food because they are considered adulterated They can t be used for animal feed unless they contain no chemical additives are heat treated and further processed This means that the claims by some so called pet nutritionists that dog food contains roadkill or euthanized animals is bogus disinformation n nSupply Chain Issues n nAmericans are currently experiencing what happens when there are supply chain disruptions to our food supply There are empty shelves and some basic food items simply are not available This is happening whether it is food for ourselves or food for Fluffy and Fido n nIt is easy to see how pet food is impacted Walk down the pet food aisle of grocery stores and pet food stores and you ll notice feet upon feet of empty shelves Some stores have chosen to spread out food on the shelves to make it less apparent but the fact is there s a lot of pet food missing n nCauses of Supply Chain Issues Starting in and Ongoing n nCOVID and COVID policies wreaked havoc on the world in Shutdowns and lockdowns as well as other regulations created a perfect storm of supply chain failure No sector has been left untouched from shortages of containers and trucks to move them empty containers stuck in ports and vessels waiting offshore for weeks to offload their cargo Then there were surging thefts of container cargo Once products are unloaded truck carriers are facing driver shortages and railways are overwhelmed in some areas became the year of the supply chain disruption and it s continuing into n nHow is Pet Food Impacted n nThe pet food industry mirrors the main economy Dana Brooks President of the Pet Food Institute noted recently Manufacturers are experiencing challenges in every node of the supply chain from the ingredient sourcing to transportation and employee shortages n nWhen the pandemic first started hospitality firms and other businesses linked to human food production shut down for public safety Manufacturers of pet food lost a key source of their ingredients With the vast majority of the workforce working remotely from home people turned to pets for companionship and more than million households adopted a new pet between March and December of n nEven now two years later pet food manufacturers are still facing ingredient shortages price increases in processing equipment ingredients and especially transportation Then when businesses ramped back up the pet food industry began reeling from labor shortages n nPet Food Ingredients in Short Supply n nWith pet food ingredients in short supply issues with getting aluminum for cans and added pressure are put on to deal with an already low stock of food n n nOur Pets are Important to Us n nOur pets provide companionship affection exercise and entertainment to us and we as owners want the best for them The reality is that dogs and cats belong to the order of Carnivora for a reason They need meat unless a veterinary nutritionist formulates an alternative diet for our dogs The loss of animal agriculture should animal extremists win means we either lose our pets to malnutrition or we would need to let them fend for themselves which is a death sentence too n

We are down to the final two weeks in the Missouri Senate n nThis session has seen its share of contention on the Missouri Senate floor and if I had to give an accounting of how it got this way it would go like this n n Republicans across Missouri have demanded we use this session to address the following issues n na Election integrity reform implementing voter ID requiring paper ballots eliminating early voting and strengthening accountability for absentee voting nb Protecting women s sports nc Protecting your right to a job without losing it for not taking a COVID vaccine nd Stopping the teaching of Critical Race Theory in our schools and increasing accountability of public schools to parents ne Repealing the gas tax increase passed by moderate Republicans last year nf Opposing the Joe Biden spending spree disaster in Washington DC ng Pass a map to reinforce Republican majorities in the US Congress n nWith session days to go NOT ONE of these priorities have passed the Missouri Senate one of the reddest states in America n n As a result a minority of Republicans informally known as the Conservative Caucus are furious They have used their power in the chamber to disrupt the passage of other non priorities to try and force the moderate Republicans to bring the real and urgent issues listed above to final passage The conservatives pursued long lasting filibusters on the redistricting process fighting for a map and forced illuminating votes on other leftist leaning bills to further expose the actions of the moderate Republicans This is the heart of the contention n n In the midst of this the Republican public has become further aware of the pattern of bad votes and actions moderate Republicans have been taking This has led to a series of primary challenges to the re election of some moderate Senators in the nupcoming election cycle further heightening the tension within the Senate Chamber n n Some moderate Republicans fearing electoral backlash have begun fundraising from some very powerful special interests in Jefferson City to raise millions to defend themselves in re election notably more than million has been set aside in a special interest Political Action Committee called Right Path PAC to defend these moderates n n In addition with six open seats up for election in the Missouri Senate that brings a total of Republican seats possibly switching from the conservative side to the moderate and vice versa Already Senators are jockeying coalitions for a leadership race that will take place once the August Republican primary concludes none of the seats in question have a competitive general election n nThis is the political and policy reality of the Republican Missouri Senate right now n nAll of the contention would leave the Republican Senate Caucus if the caucus would prioritize passing the issues voters sent us here to address This isn t about social media setting differences aside listening to others or believing the person next to you is good at heart n nThis is about fighting and winning in a war of ideas happening RIGHT NOW in America that if we lose will cost the next generation of Missourians their chance at life liberty and the pursuit of their own happiness n nI believe the ideas articulated by the Republican brand protecting our rights limiting the role of government in our lives are worth fighting for If that means kicking over some apple carts in Jefferson City count me in

ALAMO DISRESPECTING GEORGE P BUSH MAY KILL FAMILY S POLITICAL DYNASTY n nPlease see the excellent article by Isabel Vincent that just came out in the NEW YORK POST on March describing the potential downfall of George P Bush The piece goes into quite a bit of detail about the impact that ALL OF US have had in the fight to Save the Alamo n nYou can press this link to see the original have also posted the full article below n n n nAlamo disrespecting George P Bush may kill family s political dynasty nBy Isabel Vincent nMarch am nNEW YORK POST n nAt first glance George Prescott Bush seems the ideal political candidate in a state where his family has been a powerful dynasty for decades n nThe telegenic Texas lawyer is a grandson of st US President George H W Bush and the nephew of George W Bush the rd He is the eldest son of two term Florida Gov Jeb Bush and the great grandson of US Sen Prescott Bush of Connecticut The war veteran and father of two married to blond lawyer Amanda Williams Bush is also Mexican American on his mother s side and speaks fluent Spanish n nBut that might not be enough according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the Alamo Texas most treasured symbol by bringing in modern minded out of staters for its restoration n nOn Tuesday Bush and incumbent Ken Paxton beat two other Republican candidates vying to be the party s pick in the attorney general s race n nNow a critical May runoff will determine whether the fourth generation scion will be able to shore up the family s political legacy in the Lone Star State analysts say n nBut that s another problem The Bush name is not popular in Texas anymore Luke Twombly a Dallas based political consultant and former communications director of the Texas Republican Party told The Post n nPaxton the Texas attorney general since has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit but still has the support of the state s conservatives He also has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump a situation Bush hopes to reverse by invoking Trump in his campaign ads which don t mention the titans in his own family n n Under the leadership of President Trump our country was strong and vibrant again says Bush in a campaign video At another point in the ad he notes Like President Trump I will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack because Texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda n nIf Bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to Trump his opponents hope to end the Bush family s political dominance in Texas which began after George H W moved with his wife Barbara from Connecticut to the Lone Star State in to work in the oil business n n If conservatives unite we can end the Bush dynasty Paxton told a Lubbock radio station Wednesday The Bushes have had their chances It s time for the dynasty to end n nBush commissioner of the General Land Office in Texas has faced withering criticism from both Democrats and fellow Republicans for his work restoring the Alamo historic site He s also been under scrutiny for his agency s administration of veterans homes where the COVID fatality rate was percent at seven out of nine facilities more than double the rate at the state s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic n nIn his eagerness to seek endorsements from Trump Bush has broken with members of his own family becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for Trump s hold on the Republican Party n n I can t imagine that George P is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the Trump endorsement said Twombly n nAlthough he likely needs Trump s endorsement to win the race others say Bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory n n Well maybe he s not exactly a black sheep but Bush is not the guy Jerry Patterson Bush s predecessor on the General Land Office told The Post I knew and and Bush is not a guy who is a leader He s a decent enough fellow but if you want someone to make hard decisions he s out of it He avoids controversy puts his head down n nAs commissioner of the GLO he has played fast and loose with the Alamo the state s most sacred historic site he added Patterson was so incensed with what he called Bush s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in n nWhen Patterson lost to Bush in the Republican primary for the commissioner s job he decided to back Bush s Democratic opponent Miguel Suazo in the commissioner s race He wasn t the only one n n Never in my memory have all primary opponents of a Republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner s Democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn t vote for the Republican primary winner Patterson said n nIn addition to Patterson losing Republican primary opponents in the race Rick Range Davey Edward and David Watts all refused to back Bush n n There are things that are more important than your party said Patterson who ran the GLO between and The Alamo is Texas n nAmong the criticisms of Bush s work on the restoration of the site which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a

years ago I had my son Nehemiah They took me into a recovery room and where I was holding him looking at him smiling everything a new mother does with a new baby But I noticed that every time I would ask the nurse for something they wouldn t leave the room Usually nurses will just leave to go get whatever you ask for but they wouldn t leave me by myself n nEverything I asked for she would call down and have somebody else bring it up At the time I m thinking that was weird but I still never really paid attention to it n nSo the next day his doctor came in to see him and he looked at his hands and he was evaluating him and he said I think Nehemiah has Down syndrome n nI just froze n nI said Are you sure n n Yes I think he has Down syndrome but I m not for sure he said We re going to run some tests and everything when he comes to his first doctor s appointment n nSo I call my mom on the phone hysterical I was and didn t know anything about Down syndrome I got my mom on the phone and I m crying I can barely get my words out n nBut she was already waiting for my phone call My mom was taking her social work classes at the time and they had just studied Down syndrome and she already knew n nI was crying and told her that they were going to do some test at his first doctor s appointment to find out for sure I took him to that doctor s visit and that s when they confirmed that Nehemiah had Down syndrome I took that really bad to the point where they thought they were going to have somebody come pick me up at the doctor s office and drive me home but I told them that I could drive myself n nOn the way home I stopped at a gas station just bawling my eyes out sitting there in the parking lot I called my mom on the phone and I m just like Why me I m years old I have a son that has a disability I don t know anything about and I don t know what I m going to do I asked a lot of questions Why me Why him None of my friends have a kid that has a disability None of my family members None of my siblings So why me Lord Why did you choose us n nI sat there for probably about an hour talking to my mom The thing that made me start up the car and come home was when she told me You know God gives special children to special people God gave you Nehemiah for a reason You may not know what that reason is right now and you may never find out what that reason is but God gave him to you for a reason n nAfter that I started doing some research because I felt I needed a support group to learn from or talk to people who were in the same situation The closest support group was in Mount Pleasant and that was just too far away I was having a tough time because when Nehemiah was a week old I moved back home with my mother Here I was a single mother with two kids because Nehemiah and his sister are and a half months apart n nSo I was like What can I do There s nothing here for people like us The closest support group is in Mount Pleasant and that s too far to get help n nThat s when I decided to start my first Down syndrome walk I got the flyers made and everything It was mostly just my family and friends who came out Terry Camp came out and did a news story and he actually came to a few of them I wanted more parents that had kids with disabilities to show up at this walk but I had my family and my friends there who were supportive I continued to do these walks up until COVID which now I m starting back up this year n nI never would have imagined that I would give birth to a child with Down syndrome but my son is my world and if I could go back in time I would not change anything He amazes our family everyday with the things that he says and does n nNehemiah is and will always be God s special gift to me n n Shortorah Carter
