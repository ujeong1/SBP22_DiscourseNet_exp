A lot of GOP politicians and political pundits are blaming Biden for this inflation THEY ARE LYING TO YOU n n If Biden s spending is causing this inflation why didn t we see inflation rise in when Trump spent EVEN MORE money n n Why did inflation not spike back in March when Biden s only stimulus went out n n Why did inflation rise AFTER the Federal Unemployment benefit was eliminated completely in September And it was already reduced from per week when Trump was president down to per week when Biden took office n n How could Biden s spending with his Infrastructure Bill cause inflation BEFORE any money from it was spent n n Why would inflation rise after Biden REDUCED THE DEFICIT and spent LESS money than Trump n nThe TRUTH is that Biden s spending is NOT THE CAUSE OF THIS INFLATION n nSo what is causing this inflation n nThere are several factors that are causing today s inflation n n When the pandemic hit in we went into lock down Restaurants closed People stopped spending money Demand dropped Manufacturers drastically slowed or even stopped manufacturing part in response to the reduced demand and part in response to the lack of labor due to the people getting Covid and or being quarantined n n When the lock downs ended and people started going back out earlier this year they not only went back to spending money they made up for lost time This created a huge and sudden increase in demand n n Unfortunately increasing supplies is not that simple Our supplier chain is made up of millions of products from all around the globe and many of our larger more complex items have to be manufactured from other parts in the global chain and these manufacturers can t up their output until their suppliers up theirs It s not just the manufacturers that have to ramp back up it s shipping companies trucking companies retailers and everybody in between n n Inflation increases the costs of doing business which in a free market should cause a reduction in corporate profits Yet many large companies showed RECORD PROFITS this year This is because in several large industries there are only a handful of competitors which allows them to raise prices above what a free market would allow and they have used the pandemic and supply chain issues as an excuse to do exactly that n nThe bottom line is that Demand was able to increase much faster than supply THAT along with the corporate manipulation of prices IS WHAT IS DRIVING THIS INFLATION n nP S Let s remember that the President does not control inflation Our economy is based on a free market Absent extreme circumstances he cannot order companies to raise or lower prices or to keep them the same He certainly cannot dictate to foreign companies what they can charge n n

There is no such a thing as finished reform That s one of the reasons why high income countries continuously reform their healthcare systems The countries are in globalized word connected and they tend to inspire each other and similar reforms are often introduced across countries However politicians are keen to get inspired by other countries in a limited way Recent paper offers overview of health reform trends in high income countries before the covid pandemic n n Even before the pandemic countries were facing challenges which persist today The most important challenges are gaps coverage and access concerns about quality integration and continuity of care workforce shortages the epidemiological shift to multiple chronic diseases emerging viral threats as well as other unpredictable exogenous shocks These are the challenges which lie ahead of us and the competent will be forced to willy nilly to deal with it The question is how they are going to do it n n The average age of the population in most developed countries is growing which means that the demand for healthcare will exponentially grow as well The demand in future will concentrate on person centred care n n In the paper were reviewed reforms which were reported in countries in of them went to four clusters insurance cover age resource generation governance healthcare purchasing payment and organization of hospitalcare n n In reforms in countries were reported of them fell under organization of primary ambulatory care governance care coordination specialized care and organization of hospital care n n Most reforms were reported ongoing in implemented seven abandoned Health agency ledreforms were implemented most frequently followed by central government legislated reforms n n Policymakers can leverage international experience of distinct reform approaches addressing similar challenges and similar approaches to address distinct problems Such knowledge may help inspireor support future successful health reform processes

T oo many families are struggling to keep up with their bills Inflation is robbing them of the gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel I get it That was President Joe Biden in his first State of the Union Address on March attempting at least to deflect some of the blame for inflation away from the federal government s unprecedented peacetime spending borrowing and printing avalanche of more than trillion in response to the Covid pandemic That included the trillion CARES Act and billion phase four legislation under former President Donald Trump and the trillion stimulus and billion of new infrastructure spending under President Biden As a result the national debt has increased by trillion to trillion of which the Fed monetized half or trillion by increasing its share of U S treasuries to a record trillion Overall the M money supply has increased by trillion to trillion a whopping percent increase Almost every new dollar of debt was paid for by printing it What more is needed to explain the current bout of inflation Biden doesn t get it This State of the Union was an opportunity to level with the American people If Biden had explained the situation honestly and promised to slow down spending and increase American energy production it could have been an historic pivot that might have saved his Congressional majorities in November Biden is right when says inflation is robbing the American people blind And in they re going to have something to say about it What do you think

Alan Lowe for Palm Coast City Council District n nHere are some bullet points items of my platform followed by a little more detail n n I oppose tax increases n n I support a fiscally responsible government n n I oppose uncontrolled development n n I support development that does not affect adjacent land values n n I oppose zoning changes that will harm adjacent property values n n I support a healthy business atmosphere n n I support government transparency n n I support ensuring there is a quality and detailed cost benefit analysis performed on all significant projects n n I support public town halls at various locations around town to promote public interaction and comment n n I support a third party forensic budget review to identify areas of wasteful spending n nAs your city councilman I will be a public servant and a community leader that actually listens n nNot only will I bring the expected integrity and transparency back to City Hall I will also bring the truth that all city employees whether elected appointed or hired are servants of the people and that the citizens of Palm Coast deserve their respect in all interactions n nI will fight to restore trust City Council of Palm Coast and make your interests my first priority n nI believe in small government and see the government s role as representing the needs of the people and not controlling the public access to information n nI want to serve our city in the best interest of our citizens and lead others by example n nI don t want to play the role of protector but rather one of a civic partner that listens and understands that we need to build an environment of prosperity that attracts people to our city from all walks of life all age groups and instills a sense of pride in living in a community that is willing to evolve to be so much more n nI believe in transparency and creating community interactions by bringing the voice of the people to city hall n nI do believe monthly in person town hall meetings are essential and necessary to keep in close touch with the public to be accessible transparent and present n nI believe that business investments that will create lasting well paid jobs are an essential basis for our city and I am concerned that several important businesses left the city during the past years We need to work on bringing good companies to our city by creating an inviting atmosphere to entice new businesses to call Palm Coast Home I would call for the creation of a committee of local business owners to identify city road blocks to a successful business atmosphere and excessive red tape and then belp devise plans to eliminate them n nWe are all facing economical challenges now more than ever following the Covid lock downs uncontrolled inflation and an uncertain economy and so is the city However I do not believe in raising taxes as the only method to create revenue to fill the city s coffers Instead I believe in creating a thriving business environment to attract investments into our city Tax revenue generated from businesses should help alleviate the pressure of tax dollars gleaned from private residential property tax As such improving the business atmosphere will bring more businesses from which the city can improve the tax base and reduce the burden on the individual n nOUR SHERIFF PARAMEDICS AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS n nSheriff nI support our county Sheriff and his deputies I believe in the work they are doing and their efforts to stem crime and remove drugs from our streets They risk their lives to bring people to justice only to have the courts let them go I have personally witnessed the Sheriff s office close a neighboring drug house and bring the perpetrators to justice n n nParamedics nI have great respect for our paramedics and fire fighting force My mother was very ill and I brought her to our home to take care of her until the end I had to call the paramedics to our home on several occasions They were always prompt courteous and gentile with her As we have an aging community the paramedics are life savers n n nFirefighters nI was here for the fires in the early s and spent a few hours out in the middle of the Pine Lakes golf course to escape the fire Then in I lost my house to the raging forest fires The firefighters did all they could to save as many homes as possible and they fought hard I use to enjoy seeing the events and comments on their Facebook page and will push to get them back online so as to help them be engaged with the community and have a direct link to present information and advertise events n n nMENTAL HEALTH nFlagler County has the dubious honor of having one of if not the highest suicide rates in Florida I experienced this first hand when my father who was diagnosed with dementia took his own life n nAlthough there was no outward sign that he was in trouble he obviously was After he passed friends and family comforted my mom for several days but she we was were then left to our own I believe there should be a city supported outreach program in Palm Coast that reaches out to families affected by these tragedies Even if it is a just a phone call with a friendly voice saying hello how is your day going n nTAXES n I have skin in the game By this I mean that I own property pay property taxes and am keenly aware of the burden increased taxes place upon the community I understand that the government is an entity that survives off of the fruits of other people s labor I will work hard to keep your taxes low and tirelessly look for areas to cut spending eliminate waste and make departments accountable I won t play games pretending a flattened milage rate is a reduction in your property taxes When property values go up the amount paid in property tax with a flat or minimally reduced milage rate still goes up Many of our residents are Senior Citizens who fled the tax drain of other states for the sunshine low taxes and a better life on their fixed incomes We have a responsibility to see to it that Seniors enjoy their retirement without the fear of high taxes and our younger generations have a chance to start without the burden of high taxation holding them back All citizens of Palm Coast deserve a responsible city government n n nA FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT nWhen your bank account gets low you tighten your belt cut out nonessential spending and revise your budget Shouldn t we expect our government to do the same thing It is beneficial for our city to receive grants from the outside but we should not be relying on outside help to soften the impact of bloated spending habits If there is waste then lets find it If there is a better way to achieve the same goals but costs less then lets do it Although we have audits that show the city is on track there are always ways to improve As we enter a time of potential reduced revenue generation for the city we should be reviewing our capital improvements with an eye for delaying or tabling projects that may not be immediately essential

I wonder if we realize how many problems we are facing that have been caused by government programs and interference As Ronald Reagan once said the nine scariest words are I m from the government and I m here to help The reason we have inflation out of control and a worker shortage is directly tied to the Covid unemployment money and the tax rebates which were necessitated by the government program of shutting down a vibrant and formally free economy which was supposed to only be for two weeks remember The Nurse shortage and high health care costs are directly tied to vaccine mandates Obamacare and out of control government regulations High gas prices Yeah that is tied to sleepy Joe s war on the US s oil and gas industry Inner city violence crime poverty and broken homes Well those are highest in cities with the most government regulation and handouts and it s not even close It s hard to find a serious problem in our world right now that doesn t have the government somehow involved Yet all the time folks keep clamoring for more programs and more so called experts to tell us how to live When will we learn nI do think government can do some things I hold with our founders views however that government is a necessary evil and that limited government is the best government It wasn t a government program that made this country great It was hard working everyday people like you and me You have more wisdom and common sense in your pinkie than in any government bureaucrat How about we take this country back and send a few of them home I think it s high time and always the right time for freedom

On Equal Pay Day feminist activists on the left and the mainstream media peddle a false narrative of gender based victimhood in the workplace They cite the statistic that women earn about cents give or take on every dollar that men earn on average as evidence of rampant discrimination Their solution is to pass federal legislation that will add new regulations on employers that could backfire on women Spoiler alert gender discrimination is already illegal Their favored proposals will add no new protections for women n nEvery woman should be skeptical of the oft cited wage gap data point because it s misleading There are many factors within the control of each woman that contribute to the overall pay gap Join us as we will explain those factors why some proposed policy solutions are ill advised and how women can earn the benefits that they desire

In case you ve missed this n nFood Deserts Scarcity in the Land of Plenty nThe phrase food desert may sound like something from a dystopian science fiction movie but living in a food desert is a reality that a surprising number of Americans face every day The term was first coined by the Scottish Nutrition Task Force in and first introduced to the US via the Farm Bill Food Conservation and Energy Act of n nFood deserts are areas that lack access to affordable fresh meats dairy products fruits vegetables whole grains and other foods that make up a healthy diet they are a major factor in overall food insecurity in our nation The USDA defines a food desert as having a poverty rate of or greater and by how close residents are to supermarkets In urban food deserts people live more than a mile away from a supermarket In rural food deserts distance to a grocery store is greater than miles nA USDA report showed that the main characteristics of food desert areas are a very large or very sparse population low income high levels of unemployment inadequate access to transportation and a low number of food retailers providing fresh produce at affordable prices n nFood desert residents usually struggle with a combination of these factors and there are differing schools of thought regarding food deserts and their true effects n nAvailability Accessibility and Affordability Are Issues Or Are They nThe most wide spread thinking holds that residents of food deserts have difficulty juggling availability accessibility and affordability of healthy food to the extent that their health suffers Without ready access to full service supermarkets it can also be difficult for those with dietary restrictions to find appropriate food to fit their cultural or health needs n nEven in cases where healthy food is readily available the cost can be a major barrier for consumers In a comprehensive study was done that compiled data from studies in countries It showed that the cost of healthy food is about more per day than less healthy options which makes for per person per year The total increase for a family of four is over which can be a substantial amount for low income households n nIn the USDA found that million households both lived in a food desert and lacked access to a vehicle Thus the thinking goes even if those people can afford to buy healthy foods it can be difficult for them to get to a grocery store and they may therefore rely more heavily on fast food restaurants and convenience stores n nA paradox exists in urban food deserts amidst a scarcity of healthy food there is a high percentage of obese people due to the increased consumption of less healthy foods The result is a prevalence of obesity and other diet related health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease in those areas A study of Chicago neighborhoods found that deaths from diabetes in food deserts were actually double those in areas with relatively easy access to grocery stores n nConversely a study by the Journal of the American Heart Association JAHA found that association between food deserts and adverse outcomes is largely driven by low area income not poor access to food n nFurther research from New York University NYU showed between and more than a thousand supermarkets opened nationwide in neighborhoods around the country that had previously been food deserts NYU studied the grocery purchases of about households in those neighborhoods While it s true that these households buy less healthy groceries than people in wealthier neighborhoods they do not start buying healthier groceries after a new supermarket opened Instead we find that people shop at the new supermarket but they buy the same kinds of groceries they had been buying before n nIn addition the study also stated the average American travels miles to shop and percent of shopping trips are made by car In fact low income households are not much different they travel an average of miles Since we re traveling that far we tend to shop in supermarkets even if there isn t one down the street Even people who live in zip codes with no supermarkets still buy percent of their groceries from supermarkets n nConsidering that there are countless educational resources for people who wish to learn how to make good dietary choices it would seem that the biggest factor in individual health simply boils down to personal choice This is not to belittle the effects of insufficient nutrition which tends to have the heaviest effect on children in low income areas n nLong Term Effects Go Far Beyond Nutrition nNutrition or the lack thereof affects more than physical health Studies have shown that children who struggle with poor nutrition are more likely to have social and behavioral problems in school This can lead to students dropping out of school and other types of failed education which very often result in economic failures later in life n nThe long term economic cycle in areas deemed to be food deserts are vicious Multi generational families in food deserts tend to experience decreasing wealth which leads to businesses leaving the area which means fewer employment opportunities which leads to even further reduced wealth When new stores open they open in areas of higher income to reduce the risk of their investment The decreased buying power of customers in low income areas and the threat of higher crime rates whether real or perceived tend to push businesses away Some go so far as to label the results food apartheid since food insecurity affects minority groups to a greater degree n nFood Insecurity Most Prevalent in Southern States nIt follows then that the highest concentration of food insecure communities are located in areas with higher populations of minority groups n nThe USDA has calculated that there are total census tracts in the United States which fall within the parameters to be considered a food desert The USDA website states a census tract is a small relatively permanent subdivision of a county that usually contains between and people but generally averages around people Rural counties make up of total counties in the country but they make up of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity n nA December USDA survey showed that of total US households were food insecure with being at low food security status and at very low food security status These percentages account for million people including million children Of those children live in households that experience very low food security n nThis particular survey defined low food insecure households as being able to obtain enough food to mostly maintain their eating patterns or to reduce food intake by eating less varied diets This group was also able to rely on assistance from federal programs and local food pantries n nVery low food security status was defined by having the normal eating patterns of one or more household members disrupted by food scarcity and by cases of overall food intake being reduced due to lack of money and other resources to obtain food n nNo Easy Answers nConsidering the differing schools of thought on the issue is not clear how geographic location truly affects food insecurity or what measures to alleviate it are most effective n nOhio University writes Dealing with food deserts across the United States is a complex issue with no easy solutions It is difficult for communities and cities to simply build more grocery stores develop more transit options or find ways to help individuals generate more income to purchase healthy foods nConversely New York University stated Over the past decade federal and local governments in the United States have spent hundreds of millions of dollars encouraging grocery stores to open in food deserts The federal Healthy Food Financing Initiative has leveraged over billion in financing for grocers in under served areas Meanwhile cities such as Houston and Denver have sought to institute related measures at the local level n nSome mistakenly believe that subsidies for commodities like corn and soy work to lower the prices of foods that are more processed and less healthy Some blame the market driven polices that focus on turning out inexpensive high volume highly processed food products for maximum industry profit One school of thought holds that placing a sin tax on less healthy foods would discourage their purchase n nWhile a variety of programs exist to help with food insecurity they can only do so much especially considering that inflation supply chain issues and food shortages are currently impacting all Americans In fact researchers at Northwestern University found that food insecurity more than doubled because of the covid pandemic affecting up to of households Of course the already precarious situation of millions of food insecure people has been greatly exacerbated by the current state of affairs in our nation n nThrough the tangled web of issues surrounding food insecurity one thing is abundantly clear our nation s food producers are more important than ever

Are you better off now than you were a year ago nBy Mike Huckabee March n n n One of the standard questions anyone running for reelection will have to face from opponents is Are you better off now than you were a year ago A new Issues Insights TIPP poll asked Americans that question and the answer doesn t bode well for the Democrats who ve been completely in charge of the government since January n n said they re worse off said they re about the same and remember what a year ago was like and fewer than said they were better off n nAs noted at the link Biden told fellow Democrats earlier this month that under him the US has experienced the best economic growth in the last four decades claiming We did it alone Without one single solitary Republican vote It was the Democrats it was you that brought us back n nIt s interesting how he phrased that brought us back because that s the only part of that claim that s true and this poll shows the vast majority of Americans know it It was the Democrats who led the push to artificially shut down the booming Trump economy and it was red states who led the way in ending those lockdowns and bringing that economy back Americans aren t idiots they know that allowing businesses to reopen is NOT economic growth nor is letting people finally go back to work creating jobs n nAnd what he s bragging about Democrats passing with no Republican votes were massive spending bills that flooded the economy with dollars and helped fan inflation so that even though wages are up by an average of inflation since last year has hit so spending power has dropped That s called being worse off than you were a year ago n nThere s more from the poll at the link but it was already summed up long ago by Abe Lincoln who observed that you can t fool all of the people all of the time

Teacher Retention and Recruitment Our excellent teachers and staff are one of our most valuable resources in education A quality teacher or staff member can make all of the difference between a successful and unsuccessful year for a student However in the last few years our teachers have been asked to do so much They had to switch to online learning at a moment s notice while dealing with technology shortages and lack of home internet This was accomplished with little to no additional training and without additional compensation for the many extra hours of work they gave in addition to their regular work hours Many gave up most of their summer without pay to help create an entirely new world in education Next teachers were tasked with providing both online and in person learning often at the same time even within one class period Our teachers and staff members were literally building the plane while flying it in the air n nThis type of task juggling pushed our teachers and staff past any boundaries they had reached before with technology and learning Simultaneously due to necessary Covid protocols students and teachers were quarantined for over a week when exposed while teaching and learning in person and that had to be factored in to lesson plans Sub shortages only complicated this matter requiring many teachers to work their off periods to cover other classes and teach classes with double the typical number of students to make sure all students had a teacher to supervise them again without additional compensation n nAll the while our teachers were barraged by the politics of Covid infection rates Covid Safety Protocols mask wearing and vaccines They were accused of not wanting to come back to work even of being lazy They were accused of being pro mask or anti mask pro vaccine or anti vaccine n nTo say the least it has been a tough few years and we are seeing record numbers of teachers leave the profession Retaining our best and brightest teachers is of critical importance One of the areas I have looked into is teacher salaries and while we as a district are above average once you have taught in our district for over years our starting salary is lower than many surrounding districts Salaries make up of our district budget I would like to look at ways that our district can be offer competitive salaries to recruit new teachers At the same time offering our existing teachers extra support like the Covid Bonus last year are things that need to be considered By balancing the needs of newer and existing teachers with competitive salaries and compensation we can excel in our goal to employ excellent educators and staff members in our district a primary need to maintain our standing as an excellent district to both work and learn in

This past week Congress received President Biden s trillion budget for a month behind schedule which includes requests for more Covid aid despite states still having billions of unspent federal dollars in their coffers from past stimulus and recovery bills If that is not bad enough the president also seems to have made his calculations assuming that some version of his Build Back Better legislation had passed despite it being stalled in Congress n The president also wants a minimum tax on income and unrealized capital gains for families worth more than million The House passed the MORE Act which would legalize marijuana at the federal level and impose an initial tax on purchases The bill would need votes to break a Senate filibuster where the prospects for passage are not strong Members of the Senate negotiated and agreed to a deal for billion in pandemic aid half the size that the White House requested The lack of funding for international vaccine efforts has angered Democrats and could complicate passage in the House n nRead more in our weekly newsletter gapol ga ga th ga thdistrict gapolitics Congress republican

The future I am predicting is bleak and full of despair nothing but lonely people who are addicted to pleasure and do not have proper role models never feel they have enough and are feeling empty on a day to day basis Never dreaming about anything other then sex sleep work and living day to day while doing drugs and hoping there are not any more disasters Where the average citizen does not care about the rest and when disasters happen everyone just laughs and thinks at least its not me this time People will be angry at themselves and at everyone else idealize money lie cheat steal and whatever it takes to make themselves happy and will rarely do something for someone else or even care Smiles wont be genuine and statements are empty people misunderstand each other and hate each other for reasons taught to them by people they do not know for reasons they don t understand Language will be dumbed down to mostly swear words and slang no one will write or draw or have any hobbies The things in life that make people happy will be things that poison them in the long run and it is accepted as freedom and why not everyone else does it People will ignore the suffering of others on a massive scale while nihilism lack of meaning drug addiction mental health issues crime division racism bigotry materialism egotism lack of education sky rocket to a point society will not function There will be mass shootings so often people will consider it normal People will not be as productive responsible happy genuine kind polite civilized or have any meaning in there life there only dreams will be when they dream at night and people wont want to do better then anyone else and just be average and the world will crumble as problems around the world grow and people continue not to care or do anything about it Humanity has many cancers and among the many are nihilism mental health issues and lack of a moral structure to guide them and make them motivated to treat others good and want to do better in life The antidote is meaning inspiration and love These three things can start to save so many peoples lives and even the world and it starts here It starts now People cannot wait until the world degrades into chaos and there is nothing left The Earth is dying and humanity is killing it and while they are committing murder upon themselves and the Earth many are privileged enough to smile while they do it The world needs people to act as chemo therapy agents and it starts small by helping yourself to those three magic words Everyone needs to wake up and realize that there sleepwalking into killing the world and poisoning themselves People need to learn to care about the right things in life and seek more then just pleasure not because its not ok to be happy but so that others in the future can be happy to Everyone deserves a fair chance and without this generation stepping up to the plate and offering itself as the last generation to be in catastrophic pain then nothing will be done and this crossroads humanity is on will lead to nothing short of a nightmare and that is the best humanity will ever get if people do not do something soon All these issues are a cancer and detriment to humanity and that is even without including war and other global issues like climate change Who will be the doctors if society doesnt produce the humans who naturally want to be doctors let alone good ones What in society makes a human responsible productive polite and civilized What makes people happy non violent non aggresive and willing to never try and offend anyone Being raised properly and having those values instilled in them is needed and a good environment role model group of friends is needed Without these back bones to society people will become so corrupt and toxic it will be hard to imagine life when it was like this Imagine life before covid Imagine what the next disaster will be Imagine the future generations cursing you for not responding to this page sharing it commenting giving your opinions and at least doing something to get healthier be productive find meaning and start bettering yourself a little bit everyday If not for the world then for yourself to die happy and find happiness in life and that in and of itself can save people Dont let society tell you what to do and drag you down Society is like a bad influence friend who always temps you at the wrong times and it is overtaking humanity at an accelerating rate If society were a living being it would be a predator trying to corrupt humanity into needing it and living for it Society can eat you alive and make you love it while it eats you up and spits you out while you make more babies to do the same Society is not your friend it is an enemy to tame and make it work for you Life itself is like an enemy to tame and conquer You must tame life so you can ride through it like a rollar coaster the less you want the less you need the happier you will be and life will become easier and easier as you go Society wants you to want more and never be happy so you buy buy buy These are not theories but facts if you look at history and think about how life was decades ago and how it will look decades from now Humanity does not have decades and something has to be done n nDo you not see something going on with modern life T V entertainment music all getting dumbed down and people caring about life less and less Getting more materialistic Ask yourself why do people want to become doctors and construction workers Why do people want to do anything at all Where do ideas come from What if society does not know why it is How can it be alive if it does not know Humanity is like a hive mind that is dissociative from itself and cannot see its inner working and needs someone or something to take a closer look by stepping back and viewing humanity in a new way no one ever has That is where I come in I am getting humanity down to a science to figure out what makes it tick Why are you the way you are Did T V or entertainment make you better or worse Take a look at the s s s s s etc do you notice anything when it comes to what is accepted as normal Think years into the future and try and do a decade at a time what do you see Do you see things getting better or worse Society has a cancer no one knows lying dormant and that is the degrading values and productivity of its people Inspiration is on a decline and who will want to be the doctors mechanics firefighters Who will be the psychologist Who will run society What is going to happen if the world produces humans who just want to be the average and never strive for anything and become dumb and addicted Nihilism is an enemy and a cancer laying dormant I am not your average in this universe I can teach you many things these are questions to think about You may want to reconsider you statements about me This is all without even including the issues in the world such as war poverty drug addiction mental illness which is on the rise Humanity is sick and needs a doctor I am that doctor n nMy point is society is corrupting itself and not noticing the effects it is having or the significance of what is going on Modern life is a risk to humanity in the sense people will get dumb and addicted Like humans are domesticating themselves and will not have someone to keep things running for them n nIf you want friends in the future who do not drag you down you must join my community and start building something to last Do you think it is ok to die of cancer or heart disease What about finding new hobbies Sometimes people need other people to be around to get into new hobbies and like them Spice is the variety of life and people need a proper balance and humanity is getting out of whack This is not a cult or anything that can hurt anyone I am looking for people who understand me and would wish to better themselves and help me spread my message My message is that everyone must better themselves little bits at a time and when I say better I mean find hobbies things to inspire you practice time management and try to orient your life in a way that can help you your family friends and even future generations so that you can feel apart of something This is something fundamental to humans feeling apart of a group and having something to look forward too in order to make the pain and sacrifices during the day worth it and inspire people to keep going through life and not give up Giving up is what most going to be doing and I want to start now to build a community that wont let that happen Having friends that are like family that can all share ideas and common goals and try to save humanity themselves and future generations The Earth is not sustainable like this and neither is humanity This is the last stand humanity has and the most important century humanity has ever had and people are sleepwalking right when humanity needs to do something Like taking a nap during a fire alarm and falling asleep at the wheel All humans no matter what race gender identity culture religion etc must put there differences aside and realize there is no need to be divided when unification is what the planet needs For you your family and for your great great grandchildren Viewing future generations and even ancestors as living entities are a great way to inspire change and motivation in humanity What if your ancestors knew what you were doing Or weren t doing Would your great great grandparents not be shocked at what the world is like and how it corrupted it has gotten Would they not want you to get better be inspired be motivated to take on the world and die happy You must learn to live with less or aim for something higher and do whatever it takes to get it What do you want in life What is life to you Who do you want to be Why do you want what you want Why do you want to be what you want to be Who gave you those ideas Are those ideas and dreams really what you want Is there any room for improvement Is your goals and aims in life good for not only you but humanity Do you really want to be another statistic or number on a chart or do you want to be a part of something bigger then life itself I am working on finding a way to mathematically find an equation to sustain a proper balance from studying wisdom from all around the world and throughout history What can make a human happy as often as possible with out getting addicted to pleasure or getting in the way of others Humans must learn not effect others and harm them at the very least of what they choose to do with there life as human freedom should be a number one cause of this community What is freedom Why do you think freedom is what it is Are your ideas your own or are you letting others think for you Are you ready to make a change and start bracing for impact A mass epidemic of nihilism is approaching and when it hits it will hit harder then a hurricane of addiction mental illness crime and unhealthy behaviors leading to people feeling alone empty and having no meaning and pleasure in life These are some of the societal ruptures I talk about in my material and this is a dormant laying cancer humanity has and humanity needs a proper balance You might be happy now but what about years how do you see yourself Your family The world What is happiness How can someone find the best ways to maximize happiness and manifest it in a way that it will spread to everyone around them What produces the most happiness in life without drugs addictions negative behaviors and bad influences around What can inspire people to change and realize how important they might be to something larger n nHave you ever wanted to be a part of something larger then life itself Something that will stand the test of time something that will be on every bill board commercial signs on sidewalks something that will be in movies and remembered forever Do you want to be remembered forever To be part of something that changed history and saved the world by waking people up to the dangers of the century Things wont get better for you unless you do it on your own and the same goes for humanity I want to make society stop poisoning itself

Democrats always blowing smoke up our butts Trying to change what our country was founded on based on their irrational ideas It is time we took a stand If Elected in State House I m committed to protecting the people s rights of Alabama No we are not going to accept their irrational ideas that infringe on our rights No we are not restricting our nd Amendment rights nor are we going to allow them to go after ammunition restrictions and gun components restrictions as their back door attack We are going to protect the unborn abortion is not the cure Instead of expanding abortion clinics let us expand the education and support services programs to young mothers who are going through a pregnancy crisis We are going to Protect our Religious freedom stop using Covid pandemic measures to restrict our churches During the height of the pandemic we could squeeze three hundred people in an airplane and go play golf but yet public assemblies like churches were forbidden Does that make any logical sense We need to teach our kids the core and moral character values of life that we have lost in our schools Alabama is the th in the nation for highest divorce rate over divorces a year There is something morally wrong with our society when you are celebrating your parents or grandparents year anniversary but yet you are going through your nd or rd divorce If you have been in a marriage there are always going to be good and bad times Isn t that what we acknowledge in wedding vows How many remember them I take thee to be my wedded husband wife spouse to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part So couples now give up on each other so easily in today s society if you have been in marriage I can assume you have had disagreements or arguments sometimes You might have had an argument you said something to one another in the heat of the moment and it escalates quickly What is the first word that always gets said during the argument Divorce It s like an atomic bomb of words but it is the first word to get said Out of the divorces less than will try to seek professional help Is our government trying to reduce those numbers or trying to accommodate those numbers You can always accommodate a problem without any effort to fix or reduce a problem For example we could continue accommodating the problem by hiring more judicial judges and more judicial administrative staff to keep up with the problem which costs more taxpayers more and more money as the problem grows We can display large ads offer legal services for to get you out of marriage but that is not going to reduce the numbers We could provide a service of outreach to educate struggling married couples an open ear to the problems that are happening That might just find a compromise of keeping them united instead of destroying what they have together Are we going to save every marriage absolutely not but we can make sure they are making the right choice I ask for your support and vote May th

I wrote to the Greenock Telegraph in March about my concerns that not all school children had devices despite the promises of the Scottish Government to provide them Here is our press release nLiberal Democrats demand Sturgeon delivers on online learning pledges Inverclyde Liberal Democrats are increasingly concerned about the growing gap in educational attainment and educational access in Inverclyde At the end of last year the SNP government chose to redistribute the million fund set aside for the poorest pupils in the Challenge Authorities and shared it equally between all authorities This pot had been an attempt to close the ever increasing attainment gap and its removal was a slap in the face for equal opportunities and fairness nThis was following on from two years of educational disruption due to the pandemic where wealthier families were able to offset some of the difficulties of home schooling by having access to the internet laptops and other devices However for many poorer families who did not even have one device to share nor internet access the disruption to their children s education was catastrophic When home schooling became mandatory in the lockdown the SNP government did not supply laptops to children who were without them nDr Jacci Stoyle who is a former teacher and current Inverclyde Lib Dem council candidate said n In March Nicola Sturgeon promised devices for every school child to help tackle the digital divide I am totally shocked that two years since the start of the pandemic the SNP Government still hasn t sorted out providing devices and internet access for children from poorer backgrounds Nicola Sturgeon s pre election promise has failed to materialise n The use of online devices for delivering the curriculum has become normal practice even for young children Primary teachers with pupils as young as five have been providing homework tasks reading books and other material online How is this fair if not every child has access to these critical learning tools n We know that pupils are still absent due to Covid isolations online access is critical during these periods to allow pupils to keep in touch with their teachers Local families deserve better nInverclyde schools have recently sent out a survey offering a loaned device but have no opportunities to facilitate online access The communication reads n Inverclyde Community Learning and Development CLD have a number of laptops they can loan to families who need support with technology at home Unfortunately they cannot support access to the internet at the moment If you feel your family could benefit from this and you meet CLD criteria then please fill out the form below Thanks nDr Stoyle said n This really isn t good enough and I call upon Stuart MacMillan MSP to make good the promise which the First Minister made in March last year

Some of the people today who identify as Republicans in Texas totally baffle me They have protested Covid related mandates but are up in arms because the Biden administration is dropping a Covid mandate Title They support a governor who is hurting Texas businesses by severely slowing down commerce at the border purely as a political stunt They claim to support law and order yet back an Attorney General who is under indictment and being investigated for other crimes his own staff have accused him of And they are ok with government leaders interfering with parents obligations to seek medical care for their children It is time to form a new pro family pro business party that concentrates on public policy instead of government invasion of peoples lives

I love talking with my friend Pat because he s full of surprising wisdom and he really helps me think things though sometimes n nOnce after a session where Pat had effortlessly given me a number of useful insights I thanked him and asked him if he had any problems or worries of his own Pat mused for a moment and then said Well if I could take even half of my own advice I d have millions of dollars and be president Or at least be able to calmly turn down the job offer n nWhy are we so bad at listening to our own wisdom sometimes n nI thought of that again when I stumbled across the text of an interview I gave a couple of years ago for another friend of mine who teaches philosophy classes The interview was from the year B C as in Before Covid It was given just before the pandemic came along to turn everything upside down Another time another age n nI felt like I d received a gift from the past And shockingly I had sent it to myself like a time capsule n nReading that interview from two years was like tuning in to a transmission from a calmer time A calmer Tim That too I was clearly in a good place B C and able to reflect More grounded more centered all the things we ve lost since the roaring s sprang on us like a famished lion on a dazed wildebeest n nI wish I would have looked back on these words a few times a day during this rough ride they might have helped reel me in a little and might have been more productive than watching The Queen s Gambit for a third time Well better late than never n nMy friend asked me this What is the purpose of a human being n nMy reply I think you can find a way to be kind A kindness for yourself and a kindness that will lead to helping others I can t think of a better purpose I think it sounds deceptively simple It s not just I ll open the car door for you I m talking about a deeper kindness to not respond to our worst reflexes To offer a genuine hand to someone based on the fact that you know that the practice of kindness will enrich I believe there s no stronger energy that can link itself to other people than the energy of kindness n nI see people who embody that and I envy them I want to be more like that and for that day and even for a week I do a pretty good job because I saw it happen and that reminds me I need more of that to bring me to a better place and space and a better way of thinking and living and doing I speak with a forked tongue because I m amazingly selfish in many ways but I try to balance that n nMy friend asked me if seeing an example of kindness and wanting to emulate it was related to education somehow n nMy answer Oh yes There are two types of educators There are educators who like to measure and there are educators who like to teach And I find that a very clear divide Kindness is not measuring Why do we want children to compete against each other and why are we measuring them I find it to be a great enemy of free thinking an enemy of kindness of mentorship of coaching I find it an enemy of love This incessant need to only measure as a way to define someone s capability that is a box a trap that is a cage around a young mind that has yet to experiment fail flourish and conquer and fail again and conquer again and that is a crime against minds That is deeply unkind n nAnother thing I talked about in the interview was not letting fear doubt and uncertainty hold you back n nAs a dyslexic and someone whose primary way of learning is through people when I was in college I still remember the Psychology class I took It was a person lecture hall and every time the teacher would say something I didn t understand I would raise my hand I raised my hand so often people booed Can you imagine being a freshman in college and being booed And you know what I kept my hand up I paid for my seat I know how I learn I got an A in that class Raise your hand and don t be afraid of the boos n nTo which I would add Also don t boo others when they re trying to learn We all learn at different paces and in different ways These are turbulent times but if we ve learned nothing else from the past two years it should be the value of patience and helping each other move forward As for me I m going to try to do more listening to others as well as to my better self

in our area curtailed our economy and growth into other business sectors n nTourism is important no question about it We are the tourism of South Carolina but there is more to it than meets the eye

Understanding massive spreadsheets with hundreds of stats s amounts and cross referencing between past yrs and next yr s proposed figured can be daunting I certainly appreciate the Admin s handy graphs in some of the pdfs Below I tried to put things in a simple layperson s language so I hope my breakdown of next year s budget will help parents and community members understand what the Board is considering how much once in a lifetime federal Covid we re getting and the funding losses we re being hit with etc n n The BOE is set to vote on the Budget officially tomorrow at p It s a public meeting and anyone can come in person or via Zoom n nHere s the low down and of course as disclaimers seem to be required these are my personal opinions in reading all the budget docs and sitting through extensive money talks since January The following are my notes as a School Bd member and I neither speak on behalf of the TOSDBOE nor am I authorized to do so n n we re losing students every year but the costs to educate the public school students we have is increasing as it does all over the country n we ve lost MILLIONS in state aid since n The cost to run the district for next yr is slated to be almost m and that s UP or m from this past yr we re getting of that from an almost standard property tax increase read below and an extra is from us dipping into our reserve accounts to equalize things also read below n Next yr we re getting m in local property tax money that s of our budget n We re getting m from the state that s almost of our budget n We re taking out of our Capital reserve and k out of our maintenance reserve to snag that extra cost increase we don t have the funds for kinda like dipping into savings if you will n nWhat does this essential mean We must raise the school tax levy this will raise an additional m part of the m in total n The avg OT homeowner w a k house and yes this is apparently the average house cost these days as we all know real estate in parts of town has skyrocketed will see taxes go up next yr due to this school tax increase Incidentally this has roughly been the same increase for the last few yrs averaging to since n All the staff principal asks were more than m which in a perfect world would ve been awesome to grant But of course we couldn t fiscally do that n nSome good stuff in the past yr or so to celebrate nNew elementary Social Studies program nNew electives at TOIS nMore Academic Coaching Staff Interventionists nBCBA Board Certified Behavior Analyst and Behaviorist we need n nBUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN to your CHILD IN SCHOOL n The impacts are nHigher Class Sizes nCuts in Programs French Elementary Italian nNo Dedicated Pre K Supervisor nTeacher movement within District nNo Switch computer tech upgrade for Administration Building nNo upgrade to the Pre K Playgrounds n nWhat does Teacher movement within District mean Several teachers are leaving mostly through retirement thank you all you re amazing The district could post their jobs and hire new staff OR we could move people from one building to another to fill those suddenly vacant classroom spots THIS IS IS SLATED to happen the most at OTES classroom teachers per the Supt will be transferred out of Dow School Less staff in general will result in classroom sizes growing primarily at elems ie some classrooms that enjoyed kids may see kids next yr Other classroom aides will switch buildings too As of the last mtg the Supt reported nhe didn t foresee any job losses that s great n nWhy is everything so expensive nTranspo costs have increased we re required to buy new buses as some of ours are aging out nBenefits have increased nSupport staff we ve increased staff s n nSome funding explanations nESSER COVID related M nEsser COVID related M nCares Act COVID related k n We ve also been great about applying and winning smaller grants Yay n nAccording to tomorrow s public budget presentation here are some increase and decreases in recent and projected budgets n n nSchool Sponsored Athletics Instruction n n nBefore After School Programs n n nBasic Skills Remedial Instruction n n nSpecial Ed allocation down n nSummer school n n nOT students to charter schools n n nTextbooks n n nSalaries wages nXxx n nThe proposed budget keeps the status quo it does offer little program creation and expansions to combat gaping learning loss since the pandemic started and to initiate creative ideas for greater educational equity We re planning to spend more than m on the aging HVAC system at the middle school whole project and we re allocating large chunks of the Fed Covid funds to pay for it nBig Capitol Improvement projects for NEXT YR nHVAC PROJECT TOIS nREPLACE CURTAIN WALL PART OF HVAC PROJ TOIS nROOF REPLACEMENT WAYSIDE n nThe administration worked hard to move funds around and initially we had a budget shortfall of about m and at last couple of meetings they worked out creative ways to knock down a million n nA lot of the budget is math but much is also WHAT s AVAILABLE and WHAT s POSSIBLE n nIt is not easy or cheap to provide a stellar education I hope residents and parents attend tomorrow s meeting present questions or comments and also are proactive in demanding more fair state funding Please reach out to elected officials to ask for assistance More to come on that in the coming weeks from BOE

Broadband Internet nA topic that is hurled out there every election cycle is what are you going to do to bring jobs to this county The question seems to have been dwarfed this cycle by flooding and traffic congestion however here s a thought n nOur Federal Government has gone off the deep end with making inadequate and irresponsible legislation making us conservatives nervous as to what the future will hold The cost of living is rising faster than our wages People are scrambling to find ways to save their wages in order to keep up with inflation n nOf all the programs that are on the horizon to be forced upon us one may be useful n nI am speaking of broadband internet service As we went through COVID we saw a great swing to work from home opportunities I have been speaking with people who are happy about working from home and enjoying benefits such as spending more time with family saving money by curbing commuting expenses and raises they have achieved by working jobs that are outside the county and sometimes out of state jobs that were otherwise unavailable due to physical location This could be the solution to our families concerns Those concerns being their children are leaving and not returning because there are too few well paying jobs n nBroadband internet would also benefit rural college students whose parents are making sacrifices to ensure their children can excel in a competitive job market Because most classes and supporting software run off highspeed internet these students are having to drive to locations with faster internet sources to study such as Starbucks Panera Bread or Whataburger n nBroadband will also open doors by allowing uninterrupted video class meets and faster material uploads for online schools certifications or accreditations in a number of fields which can lead to advancement in a current job or better jobs in fields they are passionate about I know this personally n nCurrently rural businesses within our county are struggling with the lack of dependable internet connectivity Examples of these struggles include the inability to run a debit credit card machine at our local rural businesses and cell phone hotspots that are not reliable enough for a debit credit card machine either Losing connections can delay invoicing ordering and causes miscommunication which is detrimental to independent businesses located throughout our beautiful county n nAnother sector affected by unreliable internet connectivity is home based employees An example is those who work for Navy Federal one of the area s largest employers of at home based employees that pays above average wages Employees have expressed the fear and frustration of always having to explain to Navy Federal that the internet was awful and unreliable while praying daily that Navy Federal continues to have patience with them Based on my observation of the housing market climbing so rapidly over the last two years I do not believe that the solution is sell out and move into town after all there are no houses in town to move to n nWith the addition of broadband not only could it make stable these examples and more like them but it could also lead to a more technical workforce living and spending their income here in our county Possibly a much better scenario is it promotes families to live in a slower country setting allowing them to focus more on the family and find the joy we already know n nDuring my trip to Greenville SC a friend was showing me how their community took its abandoned textile factories and rundown buildings to re invent the city s town life Local investors using their money invested in their town and attracted a younger tech driven crowd This crowd successfully changed and bred new life into a gloomy depressed part of town n nWith the state jockeying a position to receive million dollars or more this seems to have some promise in making some positive influences in our beloved county This is just something to work towards with the help of us all

Campaign funding tallies in tens of thousands nBy Mitchell Kirk Daily R eportermkirk greenfieldreporter com nApril n nHANCOCK COUNTY Tens of thousands of dollars are backing campaigns in the upcoming primary election including from residents candidates themselves and companies doing business with county government n nReports due earlier this month document campaigns contributions and expenditures dating back to the beginning of the year n nMarc Huber a Republican seeking reelection for his Hancock County Board of Commissioners District seat came into the reporting period with nearly and tallied nearly more in contributions n nHuber who s running for a third term on the board of commissioners said his campaign had a couple fundraisers in preparation for next week s election n n That s usually what we ve always done in the past he said We ve had some corporate people invest in our campaign and we ve had local people invest in it as well n nAmong those corporate contributors are companies and executives of companies with speculative warehouse developments in western Hancock County including from Columbia South Carolina based Red Rock Developments and each from Carmel based Lauth John Bumgarner of Cincinnati based Al Neyer and Ryan Gallmeyer of Indianapolis based Ambrose Property Group n nHuber has supported much of the speculative warehouse development in the western part of the county but not all He voted against the creation of a special taxing district last year to facilitate a Red Rock Developments project citing a lack of assurances that it would benefit public safety and schools The commissioners have since adopted a practice of entering into economic development agreements with warehouse developers that outline tax breaks as well as payments for operational public safety and school purposes n nLaw firms and lawyers involved in the western developments have contributed to Huber s campaign as well including from Matthew Price of Dentons Indianapolis office and another from an investment company he runs from Barnes Thornburg s Indianapolis office and from Briane House of Greenfield based Pritzke Davis n nDustin Frye of Fishers based RQAW which is leading construction on the county s soon to open new jail contributed to Huber s campaign n n It s not that uncommon Huber said If you look at anybody s campaign financing people that work for the county and do things for the county they tend to contribute It s not a payoff n nIndiana Rep Chris Jeter R Fishers whose district includes part of northwestern Hancock County contributed to Huber s campaign as well n nGary McDaniel a Republican Greenfield City Council member looking to replace Huber came into the reporting period with nearly and raised another His backers include fellow city council members George Plisinski and Mitch Pendlum as well as Ray Richardson who served as county attorney for years before the board of commissioners replaced him in n nDavid Clapper and Sandra Hudson western county residents and outspoken critics of the development there also supported McDaniel n nMcDaniel has been critical of that development as well arguing that the infrastructure in that area is lacking for such large complexes n n It s unbelievable that we can go at something this unprepared he said I hope to work with the other commissioners and we can step back for a minute and see what we can do to make the lives of the taxpayers better n nMore focus needs to be placed on residential development in the western part of the county McDaniel said n nMuch of Republican incumbent Hancock County Prosecutor Brent Eaton s campaign coffers consists of a loan of over from himself He said he started setting money aside more than a year ago n n Had to tighten the belt a little bit around the house and that s just the way it is Eaton said n nHe noted COVID risks that persisted through the winter made it challenging to hold fundraising events n n It was very difficult to have the type of in person events which have been the lifeblood of campaign fundraising in the past he said n nGrey Chandler a Republican looking to replace Eaton reported over in contributions much of which from family and himself He also reported a loan from himself to his campaign n n I like the idea that I don t owe anybody any favors he said I m not saying other candidates who fund raise would feel that way but I think it s a lot easier when there s no issues like that I certainly accepted donations from those who reached out and wanted to give but I didn t make serious fundraising efforts n nChandler a former Madison County deputy prosecutor added he s reached out to lawyers he s had good relationships with in the past for donations but has yet to hear back n nAlong with candidates seeking office a public question is also on the ballot for voters in the Mt Vernon Community School Corporation district regarding a new property tax of up to cents per of assessed value from through as late as School officials say the tax is needed as a decade long funding boost allowed by the state draws to a close and as property tax caps continue to limit revenue available to schools It comes as the school corporation embarks on an expansion to keep up with its projected student population growth that includes building a new elementary school n nA committee advocating for the tax increase has raised over for its campaign including from Mt Vernon staff and school board members as well as from the Indiana Kentucky Ohio Regional Council of Carpenters n nMike McCarty a former Mt Vernon school board member and co chair of the Mt Vernon Community Growing Stronger Together committee said even more important than raising funds for the committee has been raising awareness about the needs for the tax increase throughout the school district Chief among those needs he continued is maintaining competitive pay for teachers to ensure the school corporation doesn t lose them and making sure class sizes don t get too big n n Schools are the centers of our communities McCarty said n nAttempts to reach the Indiana Kentucky Ohio Regional Council of Carpenters for comment were unsuccessful McCarty did not want to speak on their behalf but said he s grateful for the group s support n n They re part of the community somehow and feel very strongly obviously he said n nBill Bolander the incumbent Republican Hancock County Council member representing District in the southwestern part of the county reported a sole campaign contribution consisting of a loan from himself n n I ve always funded it myself pretty much said Bolander who s in his sixth term on the council n nBolander added he received a contribution from the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors but that it s yet to be deposited He thinks that support stems from his advocacy for higher residential design standards as the council s representative on the Hancock County Area Plan Commission n nScott Wooldridge a Republican looking to replace Bolander came into the reporting period with nearly and raised another n nAlong with McDaniel s campaign Clapper also contributed to Wooldridge s Wooldridge has been critical of the development surge in the western part of the county as well The county council can influence that development via tax abatements something Wooldridge feels Bolander and other council members have been too generous on Wooldridge thinks abatements could be scrutinized more and last shorter durations n n We need to do the people s work and not just our own agendas he said n nClapper a commercial real estate analyst said he supports McDaniel because of his desire to pause on industrial development and think more about residential development and supports Wooldridge because of his promise to put constituents feelings over his own n n I m not against development but it s got to be development that makes sense Clapper said n nJeannine Gray the incumbent Republican Hancock County Council member representing council District came into the reporting period with over and raised another Her opponent Scott Ruble reported an in kind contribution of over to his campaign from his business Ruble Outdoor Concepts Inc

Mental health challenges have always been with us but the covid pandemic has pushed Pennsylvanians and our state s mental health safety net to the breaking point Without meaningful and sustained support from our state lawmakers many of our most vulnerable residents will confront unacceptable consequences n n
Mental health services are part of the broader system of care but when they are not available local police departments are called on to help residents manage or respond to untreated mental health issues Emergency rooms and even county jails are becoming the safety net for far too many Pennsylvanians who do not have access to the treatment that they need n nI urge our local state legislators to support a meaningful increase in funding for these services as part of the state budget which is under consideration right now in Harrisburg I also ask your readers to contact their legislators and request the same Lives depend on it

Re election Announcement nMayor Angie Devanney nApril n nIt s been a trying and difficult few years n nLike many of you there were times that I struggled with so much unknown in the early days of Covid I found strength and inspiration from many places namely my family my mamas Liza Viana with her own struggles my Town hall staff I love you guys with all my heart and Father Andy Prachar who supported me in times of weakness even though I am not Catholic He coined a phrase that will forever send me right back into the memory of those early months of the global pandemic He called that feeling Leadership Tired At the end of the day we all felt the weight the heaviness of the Covid crisis plus the exposure of the wound that social and racial injustice caused all bubbling to the surface simultaneously n nMy family sacrificed While most families were reconnecting over dinner playing board games and cooking together the Devanneys were surviving off of square take out meals a day a mother and wife who spent her time on emergency management calls with the state county and local level until all hours of the day and missing a mom s stabilizing force There were high school graduations proms championship games and dance recital never held A sadness for loss of it all My husband George forged forward and ran our business without me never complaining n nI share these very personal moments because as we emerge from the Covid crisis I had uncertainty about running for re election Not because I don t love the job the hard work and the connection to this community because I most certainly do It was because my family gave selflessly so I could take care of our residents n nWe all are witnessing that Berkeley Heights is in the midst of change Many important projects cultural events and planning will shape what this community will become in the future My local county state and federal relationships my ability to get things done has kept us safe and is helping us grow Recently I had an epiphany this is not the time for a hiatus but rather a time to lean in fully after Covid derailed what we are capable of evolving into as a community n nJust a few highlights come to mind Working with Congressman Malinowki to bring to Berkeley Heights to address the aging infrastructure and drainage issues plaguing the Township Lobbying Union County to ensure the Berkeley Caterers project becomes the gateway jewel of our community providing passive recreation and walking trails along the Passaic Driving innovative ways to fund the redevelopment of Peppertown Park to be the gem of our downtown Negotiating with Fiserve to bring in in funding for the lower Columbia Park development initiative started by volunteers n nTaking care of our seniors by completing vaccine registrations Recording regular robo calls that still take place today so our older adults who may not access technology can easily stay informed Creating a senior survey to ensure that every older resident has a voice in the activities through the creation of a Senior Advisory Committee because Berkeley Heights seniors want to age in place n nRespecting our first responders at the highest level Office of Emergency Management fire and the rescue squad Appointing our new police chief who will continue the work of emphasizing community policing Bringing senior programs like the Mobile Vehicle Commission MVC to the BHPD the parking lot at town hall so our seniors don t have to travel Fighting for accreditation through our municipal insurance company to help to give our police department the tools they need Working with our Mayor s Youth Council to offer self defense training for young women n nCreating an Economic Development Committee that provided support for businesses during shut down Launching a Technical Review Committee to help starting a business in Berkeley Heights easier Passing the creation of an entertainment zone that makes Berkeley Heights a destination Pushing for improvements like green space and biking walking paths in downtown to grow the restaurant and other industries that will service the new residents moving into that area n nKeeping a mindful eye on the finances Hiring a Financial Planner to track debt pay down debt and maintain our financial health Dedicating reserves for snow sewer debt services and more Pushing to ensure redevelopment projects stay on track so that our affordable housing agreement would not be jeopardized and we can pay down the debt on the municipal complex plus permanently finance our debt n nCreating a welcoming community where everyone feels a part of Berkeley Heights Passing a permanent committee the Truth Community Healing Committee Celebrating everyone s culture through community flag raisings events Planning a multicultural street fair in the fall Assessing our diversity and inclusion in Town hall and our commissions and boards n nAdmittedly there were a few groans on Cornell Avenue when I discussed the importance to me of continuing my work in the Township But I know I have the love and support of my family to ensure I keep Berkeley Heights on the forefront n nSo it is with great pride I launch my campaign for re election We have much more to do Berkeley Heights I m looking forward to us all doing it together After all we are better together

If Environmental and Animal Extremist Groups Get Their Way What Will Our Pets Eat n nAs pet owners our dogs and cats are important to us in so many ways One of the most basic and important parts of caring for pets is feeding them Therefore it is important to consider where pet food comes from and what will happen if there is no food available to feed them That could be a real crisis if animal and environmental extremists manage to get their way and animal agriculture were to cease n nIncreased Pets Means Increased Need for Pet Food n nAccording to the American Pet Products Association pet ownership increased to about up from in The Wall Street Journal reported that pet food sales grew almost in the year ending November compared to for food overall Pets and their food are big business So how do we meet the needs of our pets n nThis is where animal proteins and products that aren t utilized by humans come in n nAnimal Byproducts in Pet Food n nPet foods use rendered animal ingredients and by products for pet food These ingredients are not only healthy but improve the sustainability of the pet food industry animal agriculture and add in valuable nutrients n nAt the American Feed Industry Association s AFIA Pet Food Conference in January of the head of food safety quality and regulatory for Pilgrims JBS USA Ansen Pond Ph D provided a detailed account of the sustainable benefits of rendering to the pet food industry n nThese benefits included significant contributions n To reduce animal protein fat and byproduct waste n Repurpose water n Reduce greenhouse gas emissions GHG n Provide fresh meat slurry ingredients to pet food processors n n nEverything But the Moo Oink and Cluck n nAnimal agriculture has a saying that they use everything but the moo or oink or cluck In the U S meals containing different meat and cuts comprise of only a portion of a livestock animal n nThe raw materials from the animals processed are recaptured and repurposed in many industries including pet food where essential amino acids and fatty acids are valuable for pet nutrition n nRoughly of raw materials from cattle from poultry and from swine are considered inedible in the U S market for human food Rather than going to waste those products are used for numerous products ranging from pet food to asphalt suture material gelatin capsules paint make up pharmaceutical products and many many more n nWater Used for Irrigation is a Valuable Byproduct of Animal Processing n nWater used for irrigation is a valuable byproduct of animal agriculture and animal processing When livestock are rendered water is removed from animal byproduct ingredients The water is collected as condensate and then renderers treat and repurpose that water for use in irrigation This equates to billion gallons billion pounds of water released back into the environment every year To put it into perspective that equates to about Mississippi Rivers n nReplacing Animal Protein and Fat Ingredients with Vegan Alternatives is Not Sustainable n nAlmost daily animal and environmental groups are pushing for fake vegan products which are simply not sustainable nor healthy The reality is this if pet food producers were to replace animal protein and fat ingredients which are by products of human food production with vegan alternatives they d have to plant and harvest an additional million acres of soybeans and million acres of corn That doesn t even take into account the additional water needed to grow those crops n nGuardian Article About Vegan Dog Food n nOn April th The Guardian published an article claiming that a peer reviewed study from the University of Winchester proves that vegan diets are healthier for dogs than commercial diets The facts are that no veterinary nutritionists advocate for vegan dog food UNLESS they are formulated by a licensed veterinary nutritionist and there are no other alternatives Cats simply cannot subsist on a vegan diet even though there are those vegans who believe they can A vegan diet for cats is inhumane causing the cat to suffer from malnutrition and a horrible death n nIt is important to note that The Guardian has received numerous grants to write against animal agriculture Therefore it comes as no surprise to find numerous flaws in the so called study and subsequent claims The researchers of the study are vegan and motivated by bias None of the researchers who participated in the study are veterinary nutritionists Most glaring is the fact that the study was funded by the food awareness organization ProVeg International n nThe study itself was based on pet owner responses It was sent to pet owners who were the only ones giving input Their pets veterinarians had no input According to the study of the dogs were fed a conventional meat diet were fed a raw meat diet and were fed a vegan diet over the period of one year nThere were no challenges given in the study either which is a basic part of scientific research The numbers vegan and raw diet are not representative of the general population Additionally the Guardian article glossed over the fact that according to the study raw fed dogs were healthier than vegan dogs n nByproducts Are NOT Bad for Pets n nAnimal byproducts are a sustainable and nutritious way to meet the needs of our pets Anthropomorphizing our pets can compromise their health according to Dr Sean Delaney a veterinary nutritionist from Davis CA Dr Delaney has gone on record as stating that dogs and cats are evolutionarily hardwired to consume the livestock leave behinds that we find disgusting feet eyes brains etc He further states that these byproducts are quite nutritious for animals Watch a cat eat a mouse and they go for the vital organs because these have the vital nutrients they need as obligate carnivores Unfortunately the ever increasing shift from agrarian to urban population has changed the way society looks at ingredients for pet food often to the detriment of the pet as in the case of imposing a vegan diet on animals that need meat to be healthy n nRegulation of Pet Food and Pet Food Safety n nPet food products are among the most highly regulated products in grocery stores Federal and state laws and regulations apply to various aspects of pet food including ingredients manufacturing processes and labeling Pet food plants are subject to inspection by the FDA and state regulators both state control officials and FDA have the authority to test pet food ingredients and the finished product n nPet food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration FDA The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FD C Act requires that all animal foods like human foods be safe to eat produced under sanitary conditions contain no harmful substances and be truthfully labeled In addition canned food must be processed in conformance with the low acid canned food regulations to ensure it is free of viable microorganisms Title Code of Federal Regulations Part n nPet food labeling is regulated at two levels the FDA regulations require proper identification of the product net quantity statement name and place of business of the manufacturer or distributor and proper listing of all the ingredients from most to least based on weight In addition the Association of American Feed Control Officials AAFCO provide a model of regulations that states can follow n nAnimal Sourced Byproducts n nAAFCO s Model Regulations for all animal feeds require that the ingredients list include the species of animal that meat and meat byproducts come from unless the meat or meat byproducts come from cattle swine sheep or goats n nDuring the processing of animals certain parts rejected for human use can be expected to be processed into animal feed This could be meat that doesn t meet human aesthetics or internal organs Meat and meat by products from animals that have diets by other means than slaughter aren t directly suitable for animal food because they are considered adulterated They can t be used for animal feed unless they contain no chemical additives are heat treated and further processed This means that the claims by some so called pet nutritionists that dog food contains roadkill or euthanized animals is bogus disinformation n nSupply Chain Issues n nAmericans are currently experiencing what happens when there are supply chain disruptions to our food supply There are empty shelves and some basic food items simply are not available This is happening whether it is food for ourselves or food for Fluffy and Fido n nIt is easy to see how pet food is impacted Walk down the pet food aisle of grocery stores and pet food stores and you ll notice feet upon feet of empty shelves Some stores have chosen to spread out food on the shelves to make it less apparent but the fact is there s a lot of pet food missing n nCauses of Supply Chain Issues Starting in and Ongoing n nCOVID and COVID policies wreaked havoc on the world in Shutdowns and lockdowns as well as other regulations created a perfect storm of supply chain failure No sector has been left untouched from shortages of containers and trucks to move them empty containers stuck in ports and vessels waiting offshore for weeks to offload their cargo Then there were surging thefts of container cargo Once products are unloaded truck carriers are facing driver shortages and railways are overwhelmed in some areas became the year of the supply chain disruption and it s continuing into n nHow is Pet Food Impacted n nThe pet food industry mirrors the main economy Dana Brooks President of the Pet Food Institute noted recently Manufacturers are experiencing challenges in every node of the supply chain from the ingredient sourcing to transportation and employee shortages n nWhen the pandemic first started hospitality firms and other businesses linked to human food production shut down for public safety Manufacturers of pet food lost a key source of their ingredients With the vast majority of the workforce working remotely from home people turned to pets for companionship and more than million households adopted a new pet between March and December of n nEven now two years later pet food manufacturers are still facing ingredient shortages price increases in processing equipment ingredients and especially transportation Then when businesses ramped back up the pet food industry began reeling from labor shortages n nPet Food Ingredients in Short Supply n nWith pet food ingredients in short supply issues with getting aluminum for cans and added pressure are put on to deal with an already low stock of food n n nOur Pets are Important to Us n nOur pets provide companionship affection exercise and entertainment to us and we as owners want the best for them The reality is that dogs and cats belong to the order of Carnivora for a reason They need meat unless a veterinary nutritionist formulates an alternative diet for our dogs The loss of animal agriculture should animal extremists win means we either lose our pets to malnutrition or we would need to let them fend for themselves which is a death sentence too n nWe can t let that happen n nLinks to references can be found in this article on our website

We are down to the final two weeks in the Missouri Senate n nThis session has seen its share of contention on the Missouri Senate floor and if I had to give an accounting of how it got this way it would go like this n n Republicans across Missouri have demanded we use this session to address the following issues n na Election integrity reform implementing voter ID requiring paper ballots eliminating early voting and strengthening accountability for absentee voting nb Protecting women s sports nc Protecting your right to a job without losing it for not taking a COVID vaccine nd Stopping the teaching of Critical Race Theory in our schools and increasing accountability of public schools to parents ne Repealing the gas tax increase passed by moderate Republicans last year nf Opposing the Joe Biden spending spree disaster in Washington DC ng Pass a map to reinforce Republican majorities in the US Congress n nWith session days to go NOT ONE of these priorities have passed the Missouri Senate one of the reddest states in America n n As a result a minority of Republicans informally known as the Conservative Caucus are furious They have used their power in the chamber to disrupt the passage of other non priorities to try and force the moderate Republicans to bring the real and urgent issues listed above to final passage The conservatives pursued long lasting filibusters on the redistricting process fighting for a map and forced illuminating votes on other leftist leaning bills to further expose the actions of the moderate Republicans This is the heart of the contention n n In the midst of this the Republican public has become further aware of the pattern of bad votes and actions moderate Republicans have been taking This has led to a series of primary challenges to the re election of some moderate Senators in the nupcoming election cycle further heightening the tension within the Senate Chamber n n Some moderate Republicans fearing electoral backlash have begun fundraising from some very powerful special interests in Jefferson City to raise millions to defend themselves in re election notably more than million has been set aside in a special interest Political Action Committee called Right Path PAC to defend these moderates n n In addition with six open seats up for election in the Missouri Senate that brings a total of Republican seats possibly switching from the conservative side to the moderate and vice versa Already Senators are jockeying coalitions for a leadership race that will take place once the August Republican primary concludes none of the seats in question have a competitive general election n nThis is the political and policy reality of the Republican Missouri Senate right now n nAll of the contention would leave the Republican Senate Caucus if the caucus would prioritize passing the issues voters sent us here to address This isn t about social media setting differences aside listening to others or believing the person next to you is good at heart n nThis is about fighting and winning in a war of ideas happening RIGHT NOW in America that if we lose will cost the next generation of Missourians their chance at life liberty and the pursuit of their own happiness n nI believe the ideas articulated by the Republican brand protecting our rights limiting the role of government in our lives are worth fighting for If that means kicking over some apple carts in Jefferson City count me in

ALAMO DISRESPECTING GEORGE P BUSH MAY KILL FAMILY S POLITICAL DYNASTY n nPlease see the excellent article by Isabel Vincent that just came out in the NEW YORK POST on March describing the potential downfall of George P Bush The piece goes into quite a bit of detail about the impact that ALL OF US have had in the fight to Save the Alamo n nYou can press this link to see the original have also posted the full article below n n n nAlamo disrespecting George P Bush may kill family s political dynasty nBy Isabel Vincent nMarch am nNEW YORK POST n nAt first glance George Prescott Bush seems the ideal political candidate in a state where his family has been a powerful dynasty for decades n nThe telegenic Texas lawyer is a grandson of st US President George H W Bush and the nephew of George W Bush the rd He is the eldest son of two term Florida Gov Jeb Bush and the great grandson of US Sen Prescott Bush of Connecticut The war veteran and father of two married to blond lawyer Amanda Williams Bush is also Mexican American on his mother s side and speaks fluent Spanish n nBut that might not be enough according to critics who accuse him of being the black sheep of the family and disrespecting the Alamo Texas most treasured symbol by bringing in modern minded out of staters for its restoration n nOn Tuesday Bush and incumbent Ken Paxton beat two other Republican candidates vying to be the party s pick in the attorney general s race n nNow a critical May runoff will determine whether the fourth generation scion will be able to shore up the family s political legacy in the Lone Star State analysts say n nBut that s another problem The Bush name is not popular in Texas anymore Luke Twombly a Dallas based political consultant and former communications director of the Texas Republican Party told The Post n nPaxton the Texas attorney general since has been indicted on securities fraud charges and accused of bribery and misuse of office in a civil whistleblower lawsuit but still has the support of the state s conservatives He also has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump a situation Bush hopes to reverse by invoking Trump in his campaign ads which don t mention the titans in his own family n n Under the leadership of President Trump our country was strong and vibrant again says Bush in a campaign video At another point in the ad he notes Like President Trump I will not sit idly by while our freedoms are under attack because Texas must lead the way in fighting this radical agenda n nIf Bush is trying to capitalize on his devotion to Trump his opponents hope to end the Bush family s political dominance in Texas which began after George H W moved with his wife Barbara from Connecticut to the Lone Star State in to work in the oil business n n If conservatives unite we can end the Bush dynasty Paxton told a Lubbock radio station Wednesday The Bushes have had their chances It s time for the dynasty to end n nBush commissioner of the General Land Office in Texas has faced withering criticism from both Democrats and fellow Republicans for his work restoring the Alamo historic site He s also been under scrutiny for his agency s administration of veterans homes where the COVID fatality rate was percent at seven out of nine facilities more than double the rate at the state s other nursing homes during the height of the pandemic n nIn his eagerness to seek endorsements from Trump Bush has broken with members of his own family becoming the black sheep of a clan that has little patience for Trump s hold on the Republican Party n n I can t imagine that George P is getting a lot of love from his family in pursuit of the Trump endorsement said Twombly n nAlthough he likely needs Trump s endorsement to win the race others say Bush lacks the same leadership genes that propelled his relatives to political victory n n Well maybe he s not exactly a black sheep but Bush is not the guy Jerry Patterson Bush s predecessor on the General Land Office told The Post I knew and and Bush is not a guy who is a leader He s a decent enough fellow but if you want someone to make hard decisions he s out of it He avoids controversy puts his head down n nAs commissioner of the GLO he has played fast and loose with the Alamo the state s most sacred historic site he added Patterson was so incensed with what he called Bush s lack of transparency and bungling of the monument s restoration that he decided to run against him to get his old job back in n nWhen Patterson lost to Bush in the Republican primary for the commissioner s job he decided to back Bush s Democratic opponent Miguel Suazo in the commissioner s race He wasn t the only one n n Never in my memory have all primary opponents of a Republican candidate either endorsed the primary winner s Democratic opponent or stated publicly they wouldn t vote for the Republican primary winner Patterson said n nIn addition to Patterson losing Republican primary opponents in the race Rick Range Davey Edward and David Watts all refused to back Bush n n There are things that are more important than your party said Patterson who ran the GLO between and The Alamo is Texas n nAmong the criticisms of Bush s work on the restoration of the site which will include a new museum with a rooftop garden is a lack of transparency and the hiring of a Philadelphia design firm that suggested incorporating modern glass walls n n Calling in all these out of state so called experts who knew nothing about the Alamo nothing about what it means to Texas was Bush s first mistake according to Range a retired firefighter in an interview with the Texas Monthly n n He cannot be trusted with the future of the Alamo Range told the magazine He s flip flopped more times than a catfish stranded on the bank of a river n nDespite the criticisms Bush prominently features images of the Alamo in his campaign ads which also include several references to Trump s domestic policy greatest hits n nIn his latest ad Bush reminds viewers that he is a former Navy officer deployed to Afghanistan and promises to finish Trump s wall He is filmed in dark glasses riding an all terrain vehicle in the shadow of the wall that marks the southern border with Mexico n n It s such bulls t said Patterson Every damned politician talks about the wall but the attorney general has no impact on shutting down the border It s all bulls t It s almost what you have to do if you are a Republican in Texas n nStill Patterson like others is hesitant to write off Bush just yet n n Do I think he has a chance he said I think he has a chance n nBush s campaign and spokesman did not return The Post s calls and emails Thursday

years ago I had my son Nehemiah They took me into a recovery room and where I was holding him looking at him smiling everything a new mother does with a new baby But I noticed that every time I would ask the nurse for something they wouldn t leave the room Usually nurses will just leave to go get whatever you ask for but they wouldn t leave me by myself n nEverything I asked for she would call down and have somebody else bring it up At the time I m thinking that was weird but I still never really paid attention to it n nSo the next day his doctor came in to see him and he looked at his hands and he was evaluating him and he said I think Nehemiah has Down syndrome n nI just froze n nI said Are you sure n n Yes I think he has Down syndrome but I m not for sure he said We re going to run some tests and everything when he comes to his first doctor s appointment n nSo I call my mom on the phone hysterical I was and didn t know anything about Down syndrome I got my mom on the phone and I m crying I can barely get my words out n nBut she was already waiting for my phone call My mom was taking her social work classes at the time and they had just studied Down syndrome and she already knew n nI was crying and told her that they were going to do some test at his first doctor s appointment to find out for sure I took him to that doctor s visit and that s when they confirmed that Nehemiah had Down syndrome I took that really bad to the point where they thought they were going to have somebody come pick me up at the doctor s office and drive me home but I told them that I could drive myself n nOn the way home I stopped at a gas station just bawling my eyes out sitting there in the parking lot I called my mom on the phone and I m just like Why me I m years old I have a son that has a disability I don t know anything about and I don t know what I m going to do I asked a lot of questions Why me Why him None of my friends have a kid that has a disability None of my family members None of my siblings So why me Lord Why did you choose us n nI sat there for probably about an hour talking to my mom The thing that made me start up the car and come home was when she told me You know God gives special children to special people God gave you Nehemiah for a reason You may not know what that reason is right now and you may never find out what that reason is but God gave him to you for a reason n nAfter that I started doing some research because I felt I needed a support group to learn from or talk to people who were in the same situation The closest support group was in Mount Pleasant and that was just too far away I was having a tough time because when Nehemiah was a week old I moved back home with my mother Here I was a single mother with two kids because Nehemiah and his sister are and a half months apart n nSo I was like What can I do There s nothing here for people like us The closest support group is in Mount Pleasant and that s too far to get help n nThat s when I decided to start my first Down syndrome walk I got the flyers made and everything It was mostly just my family and friends who came out Terry Camp came out and did a news story and he actually came to a few of them I wanted more parents that had kids with disabilities to show up at this walk but I had my family and my friends there who were supportive I continued to do these walks up until COVID which now I m starting back up this year n nI never would have imagined that I would give birth to a child with Down syndrome but my son is my world and if I could go back in time I would not change anything He amazes our family everyday with the things that he says and does n nNehemiah is and will always be God s special gift to me n n Shortorah Carter

Illegal immigrants making their way onto American soil is not a new phenomenon but the number of crossings where they are going and the lawlessness resulting from Joe Biden s lack of border security is n nBy dismantling President Trump s robust and protective border policy the Biden administration has opened the whole of America to increased threats on multiple fronts and put American families in the path of killer drugs and human trafficking n nAnd his administration isn t finished yet n nJust last month he pressed to end Title a Trump era policy that allowed Border Patrol agents to immediately deport million illegal aliens with communicable diseases including COVID over the last few years Removing the last remaining piece of Trump s border policy would have further cleared the path for unfiltered and unvetted immigrants who are pouring into America like never before n nIn March alone migrants raided our border marking the worst month in Department of Homeland Security history And no one can quantify how many of those migrants carried with them illicit drugs or a criminal history n nDuring for example individuals on the terror watch list were captured on the border and those were only the ones we caught n nThese illegal immigrants aren t staying in what we consider the border states either They re spreading throughout the country traveling on the dime of the U S taxpayer and Mississippi is one of the listed destinations n nLast July over the course of just three days more than illegal immigrants were transported to the Natchez bus station and released by ICE under the direction of President Biden This nightmare scenario is turning every state into a border state and the crisis is only getting worse n nLast month pounds of fentanyl and pounds of methamphetamine was seized on the southern border Much more made it through undetected These drugs are killing American citizens Between October and October more than Americans overdosed a record high Two thirds of these deaths were due to fentanyl alone n nMississippi is not immune n nAccording to the Mississippi Department of Health deaths involving fentanyl climbed from in to in Overall drug overdoses exceeded n nThe Biden administration has shown they are uninterested in protecting our families from the dangers of an open border upholding law or preserving order So it is imperative we take that role on ourselves with a zero tolerance approach at the local level n nFor me and sheriffs across the country the bottom line really is the safety of the American people and the trust they place in those they vote into office We must send a message to Washington that our communities will not become sanctuaries for illicit activity and to achieve those ends we must work hand in hand with ICE Border Patrol and local agencies to find report and remove illegal immigrants n nA Trump appointed federal judge in Louisiana has temporarily blocked President Biden s Title elimination plan but the issue is far from settled Title is important but it alone has not and will not properly protect our families from the invasion on our southern border It is going to take resuming the construction of the wall and reinstating Trump s immigration policies n nUntil that happens and the federal government assumes its proper role the responsibility will continue to fall on the shoulders of local law enforcement and sheriffs nationwide
